Published in 1939, <b>Before Lunch</b> was the last of Thirkell's books published before the darkening shadow of World War II made her glittering, reassuring portrait of the English countryside (embodied in "Barsetshire," her own Yoknapatawpha County) seem more and more anachronistic. The minor Thirkell renaissance currently proceeding has produced no more blessedly uplifting heroine than Lilian Stoner, the heroine of <b>Before Lunch</b>.<p><strong>Angela Thirkell </strong>(1890-1961) granddaughter of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, was born in London. At age twenty-eight, she moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she became involved in broadcasting and was a frequent contributor to British periodicals. She began writing novels after her return to Britain in 1930 and from then on produced a new book almost every year. Her stylish prose and deft portrayal of the human comedy in the imaginary county of Barsetshire have amused readers for decades.</p></p><h2>Pirate Latitudes</h2><p><p>From one of the best-loved authors of all time comes an irresistible adventure of swashbuckling pirates in the New World, a classic story of treasure and betrayal.</p><p>The Caribbean, 1665. A remote colony of the English Crown, the island of Jamaica holds out against the vast supremacy of the Spanish empire.

For Captain Charles Hunter, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking, and the law of the land rests with those ruthless enough to make it.</p><p>Word in port is that the galleon<em>El Trinidad</em>, fresh from New Spain, is awaiting repairs in a nearby harbor. Heavily fortified, the impregnable harbor is guarded by the bloodthirsty Cazalla, a favorite commander of the Spanish king himself. With backing from a powerful ally, Hunter assembles a crew of ruffians to infiltrate the enemy outpost and commandeer<em>El Trinidad</em>, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloodiest tales of island legend, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he even sets foot on foreign shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry stand between him and the treasure.</p><p><em>Pirate Latitudes</em>is Michael Crichton at his best: a rollicking adventure tale pulsing with relentless action, crackling atmosphere, and heart-pounding suspense.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;A lusty, rollicking seventeenth-century adventure. . . .History as entertainment.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>USA Today</em></p><p>The Caribbean, 1665.

None. Certainly that has much to do with the fact that the school is the largest religious university in the United States, owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But perhaps there is an even more unique differentiator - a head football coach who is unwavering in his unorthodox style of mentoring, strengthening, teaching, and even recuiting his players. Bronco Mendenhall&#39;s coaching style is considered jaw-dropping by many and ludicrous to some. However, no one can overlook the success the Cougars have had. How does his team consistently win ten or more games year after year? What philosophy and practices did Bronco implement to create this sustained success? One thing we know is that Bronco&#39;s system goes against the grain. He believes that running into the wind is an opportunity and is key to ultimately creating a sustained competitive advantage. The first section, On the Field, discusses the challenges Bronco has faced as the head coach, the principles and practices he learned to face those challenges, and the on-field applications and results. The second section, In the Football Offices, looks deeper into Broncos system and the business principles and tools of the five smooth stones that Bronco was taught by Paul Gustavson. Whether you are a coach or a leader, the organization strategies and models that Paul taught Bronco can be applied to any business or team. Simple, this section is where the coach of the coach will coach you, too.</p><p>Paul Gustavson, a former BYU football player, has for more than three decades made an indepth study of the strategies and design of high-performance teams and organizations.

This is her first monograph.</p><p></p><h2>Egon Schiele, 1890-1918: The Midnight Soul of the Artist</h2><p>Egon Schiele- along with Oskar Kokoschka- is the painter who had the most long-lasting influence on the Vienna art scene after the great era of Klimt came to a close. After a short flirtation with Klimt&#39;s style, Schiele soon questioned the aesthetic orientation to the beautiful surface of the Viennese Art Nouveau with his rough and not easily accessible paintings. Many contemporaries found his expressive nudes and self-portraits, with their strange movements and morbid colors, to be ugly and even morally objectionable- criticism which culminated in criminalizing the painter as &#34;obscene&#34; and resulted in 1912 in an indictment and short jail sentence. However, not even his harshest critics could dispute the artist&#39;s extraordinary drawing talent. Includes 80 full-color illustrations, 25 black and white.</p><p>The author: Reinhard Steiner (born 1950) is professor of art history at the University of Stuttgart.

They were created over the first seven decades of the 19th century and were described by a critic in 1855 as &#34;the most faithful image of our epoch&#34;. The book brings together a wide range of original-source materials, including letters, critical reviews, biographical documents and photographs. The major portraits are discussed and reproduced, and more than 100 portrait drawings and many preparatory studies are also included.</p><p>This catalog of the portraits of the 19th-century painter Ingres is a companion volume to the traveling exhibition sponsored by the National Gallery in London, the National Gallery in Washington, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In the first major study on this subject, five scholars chart the chronology of Ingres the portraitist and seek to place this aspect of his oeuvre within the context of his career and, more broadly, within 19th-century European society and the history of portraiture. Chief influences in the portraits of Ingres include the classical tradition of his teacher, David and that of Renaissance artist, Raphael. Beautiful color and black-and-white reproductions illustrate both Ingres's oil paintings and graphite drawings.

Below is the spectacular Nahanni River -- wall-to-wall whitewater racing between sheer cliffs and plunging over Virginia Falls. The pilot sets the plane down on the lake-like surface of the upper river for a closer look at the thundering falls. Suddenly the engine quits. The only sound is a dull roar downstream, as the Cessna drifts helplessly toward the falls . . .</p><p>With the brutal subarctic winter fast approaching, Gabe and Raymond soon find themselves stranded in Deadmen Valley. Trapped in a frozen world of moose, wolves, and bears, two boys from vastly different cultures come to depend on each other for their very survival.</p></p><p><p>Will Hobbs is the award-winning author of nineteen novels, including <em>Far North</em>, <em>Crossing the Wire</em>, and <em>Take Me to the River</em>.</p><p><em>Never Say Die</em> began with the author's eleven-day raft trip in 2003 down the Firth River on the north slope of Canada's Yukon Territory. Ever since, Will has been closely following what scientists and Native hunters are reporting about climate change in the Arctic. When the first grolar bear turned up in the Canadian Arctic, he began to imagine one in a story set on the Firth River.</p><p>A graduate of Stanford University, Will lives with his wife, Jean, in Durango, Colorado.</p>Stranded in an uninhabited area of Canada's Northwest Territories, two teenagers and an old Indian hunter face a winter so brutal residents call it ``The Hammer.'' Gabe, 15, has come to boarding school in Yellow Knife to be nearer his oilman father. When his taciturn Athapaskan roommate, Raymond, quits school to fly back to his village, Gabe goes along. A spur-of-the- moment trip to see spectacular Virginia Falls turns into disaster when plane and pilot are swept away. Gabe and Raymond are left with a small cache of survival gear, plus a third passenger, Raymond's great-uncle, Johnny Raven, to keep them alive. Johnny teaches his two charges rudimentary survival skills, then finds them an old cabin in which to hole up before he dies. Weeks and repeated brushes with death later, the destruction of their food supply by a grizzly bear forces them into a grueling trek to Raymond's home. Although Hobbs (Beardance, 1993, etc.) doesn't write with the immediacy or meticulous attention to detail that Gary Paulsen brings to Brian's Winter (1996) or its prequel, Hatchet (1987), he summons plenty of uncontrived danger for his characters to face both foolishly and heroically. The conflict between modern and traditional ways is pervasive, as Raymond, a misfit in both worlds, struggles to find out who he is. (Fiction. 10-13) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But the events of these turbulent years test their marriage and their love. </p><p>As Ross launches into a bitter struggle for the right of the mining communities, Demelza's efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry (and her husband) place her in increasingly odd and embarrassing situations. When tragedy strikes and sows the seeds of an enduring rivalry between Ross and the powerful George Warleggan, will Demelza manage to bridge their differences before they destroy her and her husband's chance at happiness?</p><p>Against the stunning backdrop of eighteenth century Cornwall, <em>Demelza</em> sweeps readers into one of the greatest love stories of all time.</p></p><p>Winston Graham was the author of forty novels. His books have been widely translated and his famous series has been developed into two television series shown in 24 countries. Winston Graham was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1983 was awarded the OBE.<p>From Chapter 1</p> <p>There could have been prophecy in the storm that blew up at the time of Julia's birth.</p> <p>May month was not a time for heavy gales, but the climate of Cornwall is capri�cious as any child ever born. It had been a kindly enough spring, as kindly as the summer and winter that had gone before it; mild, soft, comfortable weather; and the land was already heavy with green things. Then May broke rainy and gusty, and the blossom suffered here and there and the hay leaned about looking for support.</p> <p>On the night of the fifteenth, Demelza felt her first pains. Even then for a while she gripped the bedpost and thought the matter all round before she said anything. All along she had viewed the coming ordeal with a calm and philosophical mind and had never troubled Ross with false alarms. She did not want to begin so late. Last evening she had been out in her beloved garden, digging round the young plants; then as it was going dark she had found a disgruntled hedgehog and had played with him, trying to persuade him to take some bread and milk, and had only come in reluctantly as the sky clouded and it went cold.</p> <p>This now-this thing in the middle of the night-might yet be only the result of getting overtired.</p> <p>But when it began to feel as if someone was kneeling on her backbone and trying to break it, she knew it was not.</p> <p>She touched Ross's arm and he woke instantly.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"I think," she said, "I think you will have to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He sat up. "Why? What is it?"</p> <p>"I have a pain."</p> <p>"Where? Do you mean..."</p> <p>"I have a pain," she said primly. "I think twould be as well to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He climbed quickly out of bed, and she listened to the scratch of flint and steel. After a moment the tinder caught and he lit a candle. The room flickered into view: heavy teak beams, the curtain over the door moving gently in the breeze, the low window seat hung with pink grogram, her shoes as she had kicked them off, one wooden sole upmost, Joshua's spyglass, Ross's pipe, Ross's book, and a fly crawling.</p> <p>He looked at her and at once knew the truth. She smiled a pallid apology. He went across to the table by the door and poured her a glass of brandy.</p> <p>"Drink this. I will send Jud for Dr. Choake." He began to pull on his clothes, anyhow.</p> <p>"No, no, Ross; do not send yet. It is the middle of the night. He will be asleep."</p> <p>Whether Thomas Choake should be called in to her had been a dissension between them for some weeks. Demelza could not forget that twelve months ago she had been a maidservant and that Choake, though only a physician, owned a small estate which, even if it had been bought with his wife's money, put him on a level from which the likes of her would be seen as unimportant chattels. That was until Ross married her. Since then she had grown to her position. She could put on a show of refinement and good manners, and not at all a bad show at that, but a doctor was different. A doctor caught one at a disadvantage. If the pain was bad, she would almost certainly swear in the old way she had learned from her father, not a few genteel "damn mes" and "by Gods," as anyone might excuse from a lady in trouble. To have a baby and be forced to act genteel at the same time was more than Demelza could look forward to.</p> <p>Besides, she didn't want a man about. It wasn't decent. Her cousin-in-law, Elizabeth, had had him, but Elizabeth was an aristocrat born and bred, and they looked at things different. <i>She </i>would far rather have had old Aunt Betsy Triggs from Mellin, who sold pilchards and was a rare strong hand when it came to babies.</p> <p>But Ross was the more determined and he had had his way. She was not unprepared for his curt, "Then he shall be woke," as he left the room.</p> <p><i>"Ross!" </i>She called him back. For the moment the pain had gone.</p> <p>"Yes?" His strong, scarred, introspective face was half lit by the candle; the upgrowing dark hair was ruffled and hardly showed its hint of copper; his shirt was open at the throat. This man...aristocrat of them all, she thought...this man, so reserved and reserving, with whom she had shared rare intimacy.</p> <p>"Would you?" she said. "Before you go..."</p> <p>He came back to the bed. The emergency had come on him so quickly in his sleep that he had had no time yet to feel anything but alarm that her time was here and relief that it might soon be over. As he kissed her he saw the moisture on her face and a worm of fear and compassion moved in him. He took her face in his hands, pushed back the black hair, and stared a moment into the dark eyes of his young wife. They were not dancing and mischievous as they so often were, but there was no fear in them.</p> <p>"I'll be back. In a moment I'll be back."</p> <p>She made a gesture of dissent. "Don't come back, Ross. Go and tell Prudie, that's all. I'd rather-you didn't see me like this."</p> <p>"And what of Verity? You specially wanted Verity here."</p> <p>"Tell her in the morning. Tisn't fair to bring her out in the night air. Send for her in the morning."</p> <p>He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Tell me that you love me, Ross," she said.</p> <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p> <p>"You know I do!"</p> <p>"And say you don't love Elizabeth."</p> <p>"And I don't love Elizabeth." What else was he to say when he did not know the truth himself? He was not a man who spoke his inmost feelings easily, but now he saw himself powerless to help her, and only words of his and not actions would give her aid. "Nothing else matters but you," he said. "Remember that. All my relatives and friends-and Elizabeth, and this house and the mine...I'd throw them in the dust and you know it-and you know it. If you don't know it, then all these months I've failed and no words I can give you now will make it otherwise. I love you, Demelza, and we've had such happiness. And we're going to have it again. Take hold of that, my sweet. Hold it and keep it, for no one else can."</p> <p>"I'll hold it, Ross," she said, content because the words had come.</p> <p>He kissed her again and turned and lit more candles, took up one, and went quickly out of the room, the hot grease running over his hand. The wind had dropped since yesterday; there was only a breeze. He did not know the time, but it felt about two.</p> <p>He pushed open the door on the other side of the landing and went across to the bedroom where Jud and Prudie slept. The ill-fitting bedroom door opened with a long squeak, which merged into Prudie's slow rasping snore. He grunted in disgust, for the hot, close, sweaty smell offended his nose. The night air might be dangerous, but they could surely open the window during the day and let this stink out.</p> <p>He went across and parted the curtains and shook Jud by the shoulders. Jud's two great teeth showed like gravestones. He shook again, violently. Jud's nightcap came off and a spot of the candle grease fell on his bald patch. Jud woke. He began to curse; then he saw who it was and sat up rubbing his head.</p> <p>"What's amiss?"</p> <p>"Demelza is ill." How call her anything but Demelza to a man who had been here when she came as a tattered waif of thirteen? "I want you to go for Dr. Choake at once. And wake Prudie. She will be wanted too."</p> <p>"What's amiss with her?"</p> <p>"Her pains have begun." </p></p><h2>PAW Patrol - PUPtastic Halloween Maze Sound Book - PI Kids</h2><p>It's a spooky Fall day and the PAW Patrol wants to play!

Everyone is doing their part -- Seph is monitoring the Weirwalls; Jack and Ellen are training their ghostly army; even Anaweir Will and Fitch are setting booby traps around the town&#39;s perimeter. But to Jason Haley, it seems like everyone wants to keep him out of the action. He may not be the most powerful wizard in Trinity, but he&#39;s prepared to fight for his friends. When Jason finds a powerful talisman --a huge opal called the Dragonheart--buried in a cave, his role takes on new importance. The stone seems to sing to Jason&#39;s very soul -- showing him that he is meant for more than anyone guessed. Trinity&#39;s guardians take the stone away after they realize that it may be a weapon powerful enough to save them all. Without any significant power of his own, and now without the stone, what can Jason possibly do to help the people he cares about -- and to prove his mettle? Madison Moss can feel the beating heart of the opal, too. The desire for it surges through her, drawing her to it. But Maddie has other things besides the Dragonheart on her mind. She has a secret. Ever since absorbing the magical blow that was meant to kill Seph, she&#39;s been leaking dark powers. Although Maddie herself is immune to magic, what would her friends think if they knew what kind of evil lay within her? Trinity&#39;s enemies are as enthusiastic about her powers as she is frightened. They think they can use her to get to the Dragonheart -- and they&#39;ll use anyone Maddie cares about to make her steal the stone for them. Moral compasses spin out of control as a final battle storms through what was once a sanctuary for the gifted. With so much to lose, what will Jason and Maddie be willing to fight for -- and what will they sacrifice? Every man is for himself in this thrilling conclusion to the Heir trilogy.</p><p>Cinda Williams Chima is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Warrior Heir; The Wizard Heir</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Dragon Heir.</em> Cinda is a graduate of the University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University. She lives in Ohio with her husband. Visit her on the web at www.cindachima.com.Grade 6 Up&#x2014;In this final installment in the trilogy, Chima spins a finely structured tale that roars to a satisfying conclusion. For readers new to the series, there is considerable work to be done sorting out the plot and the relationships among the various characters, but after a while the power of the story takes over. The wizarding world is fractured and at war with itself. The only hope for peace lies in those few unaffiliated gifted ones (wizards, warriors, enchanters) in the sanctuary of the town of Trinity. As the novel opens, one of these characters, Jason, steals into the hold of another faction and walks out with a mysterious magical object that appears to be extremely powerful: the Dragonheart. When he brings it back to Trinity, the town and its treasure become the focus of the other factions. The action is largely propelled by the emotional needs and weaknesses of the characters, and not simply by their magical abilities. Madison Moss, whose ability to absorb magic enabled her to save her wizard boyfriend, is now a danger to Seph because she keeps leaking the toxic magic that she absorbed. Her fear that this will be discovered, along with her family problems, leads to her making decisions that put her and others in mortal danger. Maddie, along with Jason and Seph, is the central emotional focus, and it is the details of their lives that make the extraordinary plot twists exciting and compelling. Fans of the first two books are sure to love this one.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You can also use small webs to decorate a scoop of ice cream, or lay one large web on top of a ghoulish cake. <p>Ingredients </p><p>12 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped, or 12 ounces white chocolate chips </p><p>Butter or margarine for greasing the cookie sheet Instructions 1. Butter a large cookie sheet and set it aside. 2. Cut a piece of parchment paper large enough to fit the cookie sheet. Using a dark pencil or a magic marker, draw spiderweb designs, about 6 inches in diameter, onto the parchment, leaving 2 to 3 inches between each web. Turn the paper over and place it onto the prepared cookie sheet. You should be able to see your design through the parchment. 3. Melt 6 ounces of the white chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over hot water. if you don't have a double boiler, simply place the chocolate in a bowl that fits snugly over a pot of hot water. 4. When the chocolate has melted completely, remove the top part of the double boiler or the bowl from the hot water. Add the remaining 6 ounces white chocolate and stir until all of the chocolate is melted and smooth. 5. Insert a candy thermometer or chocolate thermometer into the melted chocolate. Its temperature should be 86 to 88 F. if the chocolate is too cold, place it back over the hot water until the temperature reaches 86 to 88 F. If it is too hot, let it cool until the desired temperature is reached. 6. Fill a large Ziploc bag with the melted chocolate. Seal the bag and use a pair of scissors to cut the tip off one bottom corner. The hole should be about 1/4 inch. If desired, use a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. 7. Squeezing the bag, follow the design you drew on the parchment paper, making the lines thick enough to hold together when the chocolate hardens, at least 1/4 inch. 8. Place the webs in the refrigerator for about 1 hour or until they have hardened. Carefully peel the webs off the parchment. Store them in layers, separated by wax paper, in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Variations Christmas Spiderwebs: Sprinkle each web with 2 to 3 teaspoons red and green sprinkles while the chocolate is still soft. Dusty Spiderwebs: Sift 2 teaspoons cocoa powder over the finished spiderwebs. Frosted Spiderwebs: Sprinkle each web with 1 to 2 teaspoons superfine sugar before placing them in the refrigerator to harden. Halloween Spiderwebs: Sprinkle each web with 2 teaspoons orange and black sprinkles while the chocolate is still soft. Milk Chocolate Spiderwebs: Substitute 12 ounces milk chocolate for the white chocolate. Semisweet Spiderwebs: Substitute 12 ounces semisweet chocolate for the white chocolate. Spiderwebs with Spiders: Place a gummy spider into the middle of each web while the chocolate is still soft. Buttercream Truffles Makes about 64 Truffles Truffles are perhaps the most elegant of all candies. They resemble the expensive fungus they're named for, but they have nothing else in common. This recipe uses a basic buttercream which combines butter with powdered sugar for its base. These truffles are best eaten at room temperature, but need to be kept refrigerated. </p><p>Ingredients </p><p>6 ounces unsweetened chocolate </p><p>2/3 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature </p><p>2 1/3 cups confectioners' sugar </p><p>1/3 cup heavy cream </p><p>1 tablespoon vanilla extract </p><p>Cocoa powder for coating Instructions 1. Melt the unsweetened chocolate in the top part of a double boiler set over hot water, or in a bowl that fits snugly over a pot of hot water. Set the melted chocolate aside. 2. Combine the butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and pale yellow. Turn the mixer to low and beat in the heavy cream. Quickly add the melted chocolate and vanilla, beating just long enough to make a smooth paste without any chocolate streaks. 3. Refrigerate the mixture until it is cool and firm, 1 to 2 hours. 4. Scoop out heaping teaspoonsful of the chocolate mixture and quickly roll each one into a ball between your palms. If the chocolate gets too warm, it will melt in your hands. If this happens, refrigerate the mixture again until it's easier to handle. Alternately, use a 1/2-ounce ice cream scoop to make perfectly round truffles that don't need to be rolled in your hands. 5. Roll the truffles in cocoa powder. Shake off any excess cocoa and store the truffles in layers, separated by wax paper, in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Allow the truffles to come to room temperature before serving.</p></p><h2>EYESHOT: The most gripping suspense thriller you will ever read</h2><p><b>Gripping, thrilling, unputdownable suspense.

He was&nbsp;well known for his riveting biographies and masterful accounts of the history of the United States. One of the most honored writers for children, his many awards include the Newbery Medal, three Newbery Honor Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award and a National Humanities Medal. Major works include<i>&nbsp;Freedom Walkers; Lincoln: A Photobiography; Because They Marched; The Wright Brothers: How They Invented The Airplane; Vietnam: A History of the War.&nbsp;</i>Using illuminating facts and incidents to place the story of this monumental achievement in the history of aeronautics and in the brothers' personal lives, Freedman focuses on the events that led to the first successful flight and on the Wrights' subsequent improvements on their invention. Diagrams and lucid explanations of the principles of flying make the years of tinkering, experimenting, reasoning, and problem-solving even more fascinating. Though Freedman doesn't characterize Wilbur and Orville in depth, he does provide telling glimpses of the two unmarried brothers devoting themselves to working enthusiastically and amiably together (``They tinkered and fussed and muttered to themselves from dawn to dusk,'' reported one observer, ``...At no time did I ever hear either of them render a hasty or ill-considered answer...''). In Freedman's deceptively relaxed narrative, the facts themselves are disarming: e.g., the local postmaster helped to haul the planes back uphill, and the fire brigade came regularly to stand by. The brothers' own excellent photos, reproduced in a generous size, make an outstanding contribution to both format and authenticity; they're well supplemented with appropriate additional photos. Like Lincoln (Newbery Medal, 1988), this is familiar but retold in a manner so fresh and immediate that reading it is like discovering the material for the first time. Index.

Too grumpy to eat or play -- too grumpy even to fly. "Looks like I'm walking today," says Bird. He walks past Sheep, who offers to keep him company. He walks past Rabbit, who also could use a walk. Raccoon, Beaver, and Fox join in, too. Before he knows it, a little exercise and companionship help Bird shake his bad mood.<br><br> Praised by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as "comic perfection," this winsome, refreshingly original picture book is sure to help kids (and grown-ups) giggle away their grumpies, too!

The bird looked SO grumpy, SO ridiculous and so CUTE that they both started to laugh. Jeremy recognized a story in this character and sat down to write it. That story became the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Favorite Book, <i>Grumpy Bird</i>, and more hilarious stories followed in <i>Boo Hoo Bird</i>, and <i>Hungry Bird</i>.

VLADIMIR&#39;S SEMINARY PRESS ... SEMINARY PRESS &#34;POPULAR PATRISTICS&#34; SERIES)</h2><p>This informative and enjoyable little book serves as a valuable introduction to major themes in Greek Patristic anthropology-the image of God in the human being, the Fall of humanity, and the cause of evil-and brings together the main writings of St Basil the Great, fourth-century archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, on these subjects. St Basil deftly addresses the questions posed by the human condition with characteristic clarity and sobriety. He formulates a balance between humility grounded in our creation from the earth and confidence based on the dignity of being created according to God&#39;s image. In addition to two discourses on the creation of humanity, this volume includes Letter 233 to Amphilochius of Iconium, St Basil&#39;s spiritual son-a succinct and pointed discussion regarding the functions of the human mind, the activity for which God created it, and how it can be used for good, evil, or morally neutral purposes. This letter complements the discussion of emotions in St Basil&#39;s Homily against Anger, also included in this volume. Finally, the book includes excerpts from St Basil&#39;s fatherly instructions to his ascetic communities, commonly known as the Long Rules or the Great Asceticon, which emphasize the communal dimension of human identity: humans are naturally interrelated, social, and interdependent.</p><p><p>Nonna Verna Harrison is Assistant Professor of Church History at St Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, MO.

They also lack the metabolic pathways to efficiently process plant material, thus defining them as obligate carnivores; their food should consist only of meat, fat, bones, and organs. These are two very simple yet fundamental facts of feline nutrition. A cat is soley designed to hunt, kill, eat, and process meat. Through millions of years of evolution, cats have developed unique characteristics of anatomy, physiology, metabolism, and behavior indicative of obligate carnivores. Many feline diseases such as diabetes, obesity, urinary tract disorders, chronic renal disease, and irritable bowel syndrome can be directly attributed to low moisture, low-meat-protein, and high-carbohydrate levels that plague many of today&#x2019;s commercially produced cat foods. Many cats survive on these dry, supplemented, plant-based diets but they do not thrive. This book will discuss basic feline anatomy and physiology (explaining how a cat's body metabolizes nutrients) coupled with interpreting pet food labels which will help you make healthy selections whether choosing to purchase commercial foods or making a home-prepared raw diet to feed your cat.</p><p>Lynn is a former, professionally-trained, veterinary technician and has been a feline advocate for over two decades. She has spent more than 25 years working in the fields of biology and chemistry.

Although the authors came from different backgrounds, there is one message, one theme, one thread that runs throughout the entire Bible from the first book, Genesis, to the last book, Revelation. That message is God&#x2019;s redeeming love for mankind&#x2014;a message that is as relevant for us today as it was two thousand years ago.The five books of The Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel) cover a significant time span and present a wide array of messages. Isaiah spoke to the nation of Judah about 150 years before their exile into Babylonia and called them to be faithful to God. Jeremiah cried out to those same people on the brink of that exile and pleaded for their repentance. Lamentations, written by Jeremiah, presents a dirge as Judah went into exile. The last two major prophets, Ezekiel and Daniel, spoke and wrote to the people in exile, encouraging them to remember that God was still in control and would eventually restore the spiritual fortunes of His disciplined nation.Three of these five books are quite long, and all of them can, at times, be difficult to understand. However, the time and effort invested in striving to understand these writings will pay huge dividends. It has been said that no other section of the Bible offers such a majestic and highly exalted picture of God. His sovereignty is mind-boggling. His glory is breathtaking. And in reading these books, our faith finds new depths of confidence.Get ready to meet the God of the prophecies and to be amazed at the prophecies of God as they unfold in these first five prophetical books.</p><p>God&#x2019;s Amazing Word.

(The Big Ten)</h2><p>The Bible is a cobbled-together selection of ancient writings that have been changed so many times by so many people over hundreds of years that it is surely the text can no longer be trusted--right? Certainly, there are plenty of people who take this view. In this book, Timothy Paul Jones addresses the fact that the Bible is a difficult book to believe, filled with of incidents that seem highly improbable, if not impossible. Written for people who are skeptical when it comes to the Bible&#39;s accuracy and authority, this book takes a reasonable look at the claims made about the Bible.</p><p>What evidence is there that the Bible is true?<b>Excerpt from <i>Why Should I Trust the Bible?</i></b><b><i></i></b> It's possible that you're someone who's perfectly willing to believe a story with or without evidence. Perhaps you repost stories on social media without ever checking to see if they might be urban legends. Maybe it's never occurred to you that believing a sacred text that exalts a wandering miracle-worker who's been missing from this planet for almost two thousand years is at least slightly strange.&nbsp;<br><br>If that's you, don't bother reading this book, because I didn't write this book with you in mind.&nbsp;<br><br>The words that I've penned in these pages are for people who fact-check every claim they see on social media and second-guess almost every story they hear. When it comes to trusting the Bible, this book is for people for whom skepticism has at some point felt more natural than faith.<br><br>In short, it's for people who are a lot like me.&nbsp;<br><br>I haven't always been this way. Truth be told, I spent nearly two decades of my life assuming that conversations with an invisible friend were perfectly normal, as long as that friend's name happened to be Jesus. I didn't always do what I was told that Jesus desired. And yet, I never doubted that he was present, watching me from a gilded throne somewhere along the hemline of the Milky Way. Those assumptions began to fall apart for me at a library desk in a college town on the plains of northeast Kansas. For me, that desk became an altar where one form of faith died three decades ago and a better set of beliefs rose to take its place.<br><br><b>Lies I Learned about the Bible&nbsp;</b><br>I started college in the gap between U2's&nbsp;<i>Rattle and Hum</i><i>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Achtung Baby!&nbsp;</i>albums, in the year that Macauley Culkin stayed home alone and Wilson Phillips held on for one more day. Prior to my first semester of college, it had never occurred to me to question anything I read in the Bible. In the churches that my family attended, any doubts about the Bible were met with a curious combination of hubris and fear. The polyester-clad pastors of these churches seemed cocksure that there were no problems or difficulties to be found in the Scriptures. And yet, even the slightest question about potential difficulties seemed to trigger terrified outbursts at the decadent culture in which our church stood as a lonely fortress of authentic faith.<br><br>In my early teenage years, the proofs that I heard bellowed from those plywood pulpits seemed ironclad. I knew the earth had to be thousands of years old--not billions--because one pastor had shown us a photograph of human and dinosaur footprints fossilized side-by-side in the Paluxy riverbed in Texas. I trusted the hand-copied manuscripts that preceded our printed Bibles because a speaker at a preaching conference I'd attended had told us that these words had been preserved for thousands of years without a single copying variation, if you looked in the right manuscripts. I knew the Bible had to be precise even in the most minute scientific details because I'd heard about astronomers at NASA who found a mysterious gap in planetary movements from the distant past; the missing time remained a mystery until the scientists corrected their calculations to include the time when the sun "hasted not to go down about a whole day" according to the book of Joshua in the Bible (Joshua 10:13 KJV).&nbsp;<br><br>As far as I could tell, the only reason that anyone might find it difficult to trust the Bible was because they were rejecting evidences that were obvious to everyone.<br><br>And then I went to college.&nbsp;<br><br>No one in my family had ever earned a college degree, so I had no idea what to expect when I started classes that August. It was a Christian college, and most of the professors believed the Bible--but not in the same way that I'd been taught to believe the Bible. When I mentioned the Paluxy riverbed footprints in a class discussion of the book of Genesis, the professor seemed unimpressed and asked for citations that referenced newspapers or academic journals. It wasn't long before I discovered that the evidences I had heard from the lips of preachers and conference speakers were little more than fundamentalist urban legends. NASA has never misplaced a day; not one of the surviving hand-copied portions of the New Testament agrees completely with all the others; and, the fossilized footprints in Texas were never human in the first place. There were other similar claims that had shaped my childhood theology as well. And yet, the more I learned, the more these meager evidences began to fracture under an unrelenting freight of facts.<br><br>It was around this time that I began working evening shifts at a library to pay my way through college. Each evening, after shelving the books that had been returned that day, it was my responsibility to monitor a mostly-empty library from a desk near the entrance--which provided me with access to tens of thousands of books and plenty of time.<br><br>What I discovered while re-shelving books and magazines was a deep ore of writings that resonated with my growing frustration with the fabricated claims that had supported my faith. One of the first such books I read was Bertrand Russell's bluntly-labeled collection of essays&nbsp;<i>Why I Am Not a Christian.</i>&nbsp;After that, I found a book by G.A. Wells that asked&nbsp;<i>Did Jesus Exist?, </i>followed by a mixed bag of conspiracy theories about the resurrection of Jesus. Not all of the books were equally convincing, but every one of them chipped away at assumptions I had held since childhood.<br><br>By the time winter leached the last remnants of green from the patchwork of wheat fields that surrounded this college town, I was skimming early papers from the Jesus Seminar and consuming as many back issues of&nbsp;<i>The Humanist</i>&nbsp;magazine as I could find. I plowed through every book on the stack of shelves labeled "Atheism," and I was enthralled. Each text felt like an intellectual feast of forbidden fruit, thrilling yet chilling because I was gingerly treading pathways that I had never even considered before.<br><br>At some point in that journey, I passed through a door that I did not recognize until it was behind me. When I turned to look back through the door, I saw the faith I had learned in the churches of my adolescent years crumbling into ashes on the other side.<br><br>I do not miss it.<br><br><b>Faith, Facts, and Evidence&nbsp;</b><br>Today, three decades after I read Bertrand Russell's&nbsp;<i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i>&nbsp;for the first time, I embrace many of the truths that I struggled to believe during that year or two of doubt as well as some beliefs that I never even knew when I began that journey. I believe in a divine Messiah who drew his first ragged breath between a virgin's knees, a wandering teacher who called his followers to seek justice for the marginalized and to identify with the oppressed, a crucified Jew who checked out of his own tomb alive and well, and a risen King who commissioned his followers to proclaim the good news of his kingdom in every nation. I believe the prophecies that point forward to him in the Old Testament and the recollections about him that fill the New Testament. I believe that God will one day re-create this world and flood every crevasse and crest of the cosmos with equity and justice. I believe that the Bible--as it was originally written and intended to be read--tells the truth.<br><br>I do not accept any of these claims blindly. I am fully aware that I and billions of others around the globe might be wrong, and there are moments when I feel the weight of this possibility more strongly than others. Yet the deeper I've delved into the claims of Scripture, the more I've come to believe that this faith makes the best sense of the evidence.<br><br><i>Why Should I Trust the Bible?</i>&nbsp;is a journey through the reasons and evidences that God used as a means to draw me back to faith--but it's not only a journey, it's also an invitation. It's an invitation for you to join me on this journey and to consider where it might lead you.<br></p><h2>Design Thread</h2><p>Kit Kemp is back with another colorful and exciting interiors book that showcases her unique approach to design.<br><br>For over 20 years, Kit Kemp has been at the forefront of the international design community, developing a signature style which mixes contemporary works of art by both well-known artists and unknowns -- all of whom paint with soul as much as skill -- with Kit's own furniture designs, antiques, and junk shop finds.

Dulles's The Craft of Intelligence. This classic of spycraft is based on Allen Dulles's incomparable experience as a diplomat, international lawyer, and America's premier intelligence officer. Dulles was a high-ranking officer of the CIA's predecessor--the Office of Strategic Services--and was present at the inception of the CIA, where he served eight of his ten years there as director. Here he sums up what he learned about intelligence from nearly a half-century of experience in foreign affairs.<br><br>In World War II his OSS agents penetrated the German Foreign Office, worked with the anti-Nazi underground resistance, and established contacts that brought about the Nazi military surrender in North Italy. Under his direction the CIA developed both a dedicated corps of specialists and a whole range of new intelligence devices, from the U-2 high-altitude photographic plane to minute electronic listening and transmitting equipment.<br><br>Dulles reveals much about how intelligence is collected and processed, and how the resulting estimates contribute to the formation of national policy. He discusses methods of surveillance, and the usefulness of defectors from hostile nations. His knowledge of Soviet espionage techniques is unrivaled, and he explains how the Soviet State Security Service recruited operatives and planted "illegals" in foreign countries. He spells out not only the techniques of modern espionage but also the philosophy and role of intelligence in a free society threatened by global conspiracies.<br><br>Dulles also addresses the Bay of Pigs incident, denying that the 1961 invasion was based on a CIA estimate that a popular Cuban uprising would ensue.

The original and the Best!<br><br><em>"The 10 Bushcraft Books"</em> is, as the title suggests, literally all ten of Richard Graves' <em>"Bushcraft Handbooks"</em> bound together as a convenient single volume, perfect for slipping into your rucksack. <br><br> A true classic of the genre and out of print for more than forty years, <em>"The 10 Bushcraft Books"</em> is back! <br><br>This edition is a perfect replica of the First Edition, with the same size, formatting, layout, page count and illustrations, but in a softcover format. <br><br>Unlike the poorly-OCR'd, abridged, censored and dumbed down modern US market reprint edition titled "Bushcraft : The Ultimate Guide to Survival in the Wilderness", this edition of Graves' <em>"The 10 Bushcraft Books"</em> is the REAL DEAL, presented exactly as the author intended, with no deletions or omissions. It is the ONLY COMPLETE volume of Richard Graves' work available today. Remember: If it doesn't have the orange and black cover, it's incomplete and dumbed down. Don't waste your money buying anything else.<br><br>The term "Bushcraft" describes the activity of how to make use of natural materials found locally in any area. It includes many primitive skills, and to these are added modern skills necessary for survival such as time and direction and the provision of more modern camp comforts and equipment. The practice of bushcraft develops in an individual a remarkable ability to adapt quickly to a changing environment. Because this is so, the activity is a valuable counter to today's specialisation, and it is particularly significant in youth training work.<br><br>The author of <em>"The 10 Bushcraft Books"</em>, Richard Graves, is a member of the Irish literary family of that name. He is also the author of: <ul> <li> <em>"Bushcraft: How to live in Jungle and Bush"</em> </li> <li> <em>"Survival Hints"</em>, a pamphlet which was included in all Allied jungle survival kits in the Pacific during WWII</li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Ropes and Cords"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Huts and Thatching"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Bush Campcraft"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Food and Water"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Fire Making"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Knots and Lashings"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Traps and Tracking"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Snares and Traps"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Travel and Gear"</em> </li> <li> The Bushcraft Handbook <em>"Time and Direction"</em> </li> </ul> ...all authoritative works on bushcraft and the art of bush and jungle survival. <br><br>An enthusiastic bushwalker, skier and pioneer of white-water canoeing, Richard Graves foresaw how a knowledge of bushcraft could save lives in the Second World War. To achieve this end, he initiated and led the Australian Jungle Rescue Detachment, assigned to the American Far East Air Force. This detachment of 60 specially selected A.I.F. soldiers successfully effected more than 300 rescue missions, most of which were in enemy-held territory, without failure of a mission or loss of a man.<br><br>An essential preliminary for rescue is survival, and it was for this purpose that the notes for these books were written. These notes were later revised and prepared for a School in Bushcraft which was conducted for nearly 20 years.<br><br> As far as is known, <em>"The 10 Bushcraft Books"</em> are unique. There is nothing quite like them, nor is any collection of bushcraft knowledge under one cover as comprehensive.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic of Ordinary Days: A Novel</h2><p><b>The powerful story of one woman's passion in a world at war. </b><p>Olivia Dunne, a studious minister's daughter who dreams of becoming an archaeologist, never thought that the drama of World War II would affect her quiet life in Denver.

This book is broken down into sections covering American descendents from various Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, India, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Topics include the history of immigration from Asian countries, important events in U.S. history, sidebars on famous Asian Americans, language lessons, and activities that highlight arts, games, food, clothing, unique celebrations, and folklore. Kids can paint a calligraphy banner, practice Tai Chi, fold an origami dog or cat, build a Japanese rock garden, construct a Korean kite, cook bibingka, and create a chalk rangoli. A time line, glossary, and recommendations for Web sites, books, movies, and museums round out this multicultural guide.</p><p><b>Valerie Petrillo</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Sailors, Whalers,&nbsp;Fantastic Sea Voyages: An Activity Guide to North American Sailing Life.</i>Grade 3-7&#x2013;A collection of games, crafts, and activities from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, India, and Southeast Asia. Arranged by nationalities, each section gives a historical overview of the particular group and their immigration to America. The author touches on topics such as religion, clothing, food, racism, and contributions to society. Offset text boxes highlight prominent as well as lesser-known Asian Americans. The section on China includes recipes for honeydew bubble tea and Nian Gao (Chinese New Year cake); craft projects for paper cutting, lai see (red envelope for Chinese New Year), and a dragon lantern. Projects representing Japanese Americans include origami, face painting (kabuki style), and ikebana (flower arranging). The historical information includes discussion of the various Japanese festivals and internment camps. Similar projects and activities are included for the other countries. Some of the recipes and crafts note that adult supervision is required, and are fairly complex. The writing contains broad generalizations at times, such as Tea is very important to Chinese Americans, and it is served at every meal. Sometimes terms are not explained. When discussing religion in India, it is noted that Asian Indians may also be Christian or Zoroastrian, but the latter term is not defined or included in the glossary. The organization is at times confusing, as historical and current facts are interspersed with the activities in a haphazard manner. This is an ambitious offering that may fill a need in specialized collections, and useful for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.&#x2013;<i>DeAnn Okamura, San Mateo County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rustic and elegant, simple and complex, classic and contemporary, these 365 recipes will inspire you to put seasonal vegetables on every menu.<br> <br> From tomato-topped bruschetta in summer to creamy scalloped potatoes in winter, roasted asparagus in spring to maple-glazed acorn squash in fall, there are hundreds of recipes here to tempt both the cook and the diner. Whether a weeknight supper or a special-occasion dinner, every dish from January to December focuses on what is fresh, seasonal, and delicious.<br><br>Bursting with color, texture, and flavor, vegetables reflect the changing seasons better than any other type of food. In spring, such brightly flavored dishes as new potatoes with peas or grilled artichokes with lemon aioli are welcome after the cold months of winter. Come summer, menus regularly fill with golden corn fritters or puffy corn souffl�s, saut�ed or grilled red and yellow sweet peppers, and tomatoes in countless guises. When the cool days of autumn set in, cooks slip winter squashes into the oven and stir mixed-vegetable braises on the stove top. With the advent of winter, dishes such as Brussels sprouts with chestnuts, creamy scalloped potatoes, and braised fennel with saffron become candidates for the season&#x2019;s holiday tables. <br> <br> Williams-Sonoma Vegetable of the Day brings together 365 seasonal recipes, one for every day of the year, in this attractive, practical volume. Each of the 12 chapters opens with a colorful monthly calendar that provides an at-a-glance view of the dishes included. From January to December, you&#x2019;ll find recipes that suit every occasion, from a weekday family supper or a summer backyard barbecue to a celebratory dinner, and that fit every schedule, from quick saut�s to slow braises. Each recipe is accompanied with a note that might describe seasonings or unusual ingredients or offer serving suggestions, ideas for variations and garnishes, or other helpful tips. Many of the recipes are illustrated with full-color photographs to guide you as you cook. <br> <br> But vegetables are more than just great seasonal markers. They are also nutrition superstars, and we all know that we should be eating more of them. This book is packed with inspired recipes that promise to help you do just that. It will encourage you to try vegetables that you have always passed up because you didn&#x2019;t know how to prepare them, and it will give you new ideas on how to cook old favorites. So, go ahead and open this year-long celebration of vegetables and start cooking.</p><p>Kate McMillan is chef and owner of an eponymous catering company and an instructor at Tante Marie&#x2019;s Cooking School in San Francisco.

There were gynecological exams in court, to confirm that her virginity had been, as she claimed, taken from her. The trial dragged on for eight months, during which time Artemisia never wavered from her testimony: Agostino Tassi, a painter her father had hired to act as her tutor, had raped her. In the end, Tassi, who&#x2019;d been accused of rape before, was given a one-�year sentence that he was never made to serve, and Artemisia was married off, quickly and quietly, and sent away, to Florence, where her real life&#x2019;s work began. She could neither read nor write, but she could paint. And she did paint: powerful women, women seeking revenge. Her best-�known work, Judith Slaying Holofernes, depicts the Old Testament story of the widow Judith decapitating the general Holofernes, with remarkable violence. But it was her own face she used for Judith, and for the face of Holofernes, she painted Agostino Tassi&#x2019;s. It is the work for which he is remembered now, a man who was meant to be her tutor, and instead became her subject.<br>Michelle Obama<br><br>Matron Saint of Ladies<br><br>b. 1964, United States<br><br>Feast Day: January 17<br><br>We will never have a democracy until we have democratic families and a society without the invented categories of both race and gender. Michelle Obama may have changed history in the most powerful way&#x2014;by example.<br><br>&#x2014;Gloria Steinem<br><br>She went to a magnet school an hour and a half from her home, made the honor roll every year, graduated as salutatorian. But she still remembers the college counselor who told her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if you&#x2019;re Princeton material.&#x201d; She was warned that she was overreaching, that the schools she was applying to were &#x201c;too much&#x201d; for her. &#x201c;Then I got there and I looked around and thought: I&#x2019;m just as smart as these people,&#x201d; she recalled. Smarter, it would seem. She graduated cum laude and went on to Harvard Law. When she met her future husband, at the law firm where they both worked, it was as his mentor; twenty years later, he would be sworn in as president. &#x201c;Any First Lady, rightfully, gets to define her role,&#x201d; Ms. Obama has said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no legislative authority; you&#x2019;re not elected. And that&#x2019;s a wonderful gift of freedom.&#x201d; Obama used her freedom to support military families, to combat childhood obesity (an issue that&#x2014;despite rates having tripled in the twenty years before her husband took office&#x2014;she knew would be &#x201c;pooh-�poohed as a sort of soft swing at the ball&#x201d;), and to improve education across the United States, particularly for disadvantaged girls. &#x201c;Kids are watching us,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re influenced by people they look up to, but it makes us want to live right and do right and be right&#x2014;Every. Single. Day.&#x2014;so that we don&#x2019;t ever disappoint these kids and they have something to hold on to, and so that they know&#x2014;as I say all the time&#x2014;I can do this. You can do this.&#x201d;<br>Kanno Sugako<br><br>Matron Saint of Radicals<br><br>b. 1881, Japan<br><br>Feast Day: January 24<br><br>Rise up, women! Wake up! As in the struggle workers are engaged in against capitalists to break down the class system, our demands for freedom and equality with men will not be won easily just because we will it; they will not be won if we do not raise our voices, if no blood is shed.<br><br>&#x2014;Kanno Sugako<br><br>At first, she used her words. Kanno Sugako&#x2014;Suga to her friends, the daughter of a miner, born in Osaka&#x2014;ran the local paper after the original publisher was put in jail. &#x201c;Women in Japan are in a state of slavery,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;We have been seen as a form of material property.&#x201d; When the government sought to shut down that paper, she started new ones. In 1908 she attended a socialist-�anarchist rally and saw its leaders thrown in jail. The protest had been a peaceful one; the authorities beat her friends. It was then that Suga recognized the need for &#x201c;an act of violence that would shake the entire nation to its symbolic foundations.&#x201d; When the plot to assassinate Emperor Meiji was uncovered, in 1910, twenty-�six anarchists were put on trial. Suga was the only woman. &#x201c;I shall die without whimpering. This is my destiny,&#x201d; she said in her final statement in court. &#x201c;I shall die as one of the sacrificial victims. I have no regrets.&#x201d; In the diary she kept before her hanging, it is clear that she never lost her spirit: &#x201c;If I could return as a ghost, there are so many people, beginning with the judge of the Court of Cassation, that I would like to terrify. It would be wonderful to scare them witless and make them grovel.&#x201d;<br>Virginia Woolf<br><br>Matron Saint of Writers<br><br>b. 1882, England<br><br>Feast Day: January 25<br><br>On a crisp October morning at &#x201c;Oxbridge,&#x201d; a woman crosses the grass. She has had an idea that excites her, and she is lost in thought. A man intercepts her: only scholars may walk along the turf; women are to stay on the gravel path. The woman complies, and the man moves on. It is a small moment, but the woman has lost her train of thought. She goes to the campus library, wanting to see a manuscript of Thackeray&#x2019;s. But when she opens the library door, another man is there to meet her: women are not admitted unaccompanied. It is this series of refusals that would become the inspiration and opening to A Room of One&#x2019;s Own, the feminist rallying text that explored two &#x201c;unsolved problems&#x201d;: women and fiction. Virginia Woolf, who owned and operated Hogarth Press with her husband, Leonard, recognized her unique privilege as a woman with artistic freedom. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only woman in England free to write what I like,&#x201d; she observed. Woolf&#x2019;s toughest battle was with her own mind, with the mental illness that eventually drove her to take her own life before the age of sixty. &#x201c;We cannot, I think, be sure what &#x2018;caused&#x2019; Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s mental illness,&#x201d; wrote biographer Hermione Lee. &#x201c;We can only look at what it did to her, and what she did with it. What is certain is her closeness, all her life, to a terrifying edge, and her creation of a language which faces it and makes something of it.&#x201d; Her diaries reveal a mind unremittingly engaged. In an entry from 1927, while she was working on To the Lighthouse, Woolf wrote, &#x201c;My brain is ferociously active. I want to have at my books as if I were conscious of the lapse of time; age and death.&#x201d;<br>Oprah<br><br>Matron Saint of Every Home<br><br>b. 1954, United States<br><br>Feast Day: January 29<br><br>The Oprah Winfrey Show was the number one talk show in America, averaging 12.6 million viewers every single weekday, when its thirty-�seven-�year-�old star put taping on hold to fly east to Capitol Hill. There, she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the establishment of a national database of convicted child abusers. &#x201c;I am committed to using all of my will to follow through on this legislation,&#x201d; she told the committee. &#x201c;I intend to make this my second career.&#x201d; Indeed, she had personally hired an attorney to draft a plan for such a registry. Much has been made of Winfrey&#x2019;s enormous wealth, as well as her generosity (and penchant for sending her audiences home with free cars), but here was a cause of greater personal significance. Winfrey herself is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, having been raped on multiple occasions, beginning at age nine&#x2014;by an uncle, a cousin, and a family friend. It is something she discussed openly on her show, which pioneered a uniquely confessional new format. She connected with audiences because she knew people, and she let them know her. After Winfrey&#x2019;s testimony in D.C., the committee chairman&#x2014;and future vice president&#x2014;Joe Biden told her, &#x201c;I look forward to your announcement to run for public office.&#x201d; In 1993, two years after Oprah&#x2019;s testimony and thirty years after she was first raped, President Clinton signed the National Child Protection Act. They called it the Oprah Bill.<br>Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon<br><br>Matron Saints of Marriage<br><br>b. 1921 and 1924, United States<br><br>Feast Day: February 12<br><br>We would never have marriage equality in California if it weren&#x2019;t for Del and Phyllis.<br><br>&#x2014;Nancy Pelosi<br><br>The first time Dorothy &#x201c;Del&#x201d; Martin and Phyllis Lyon were married, it was February 12, 2004. Theirs was the first same-�sex wedding in San Francisco, allowed under orders from Mayor Gavin Newsom. Six months later, the union was voided by the California Supreme Court.<br><br>The second time Martin and Lyon were married, it was four years later, after the court reversed its decision, legalizing same-�sex marriage in California. They wore the same pantsuits they had at their first wedding. Once again, they were first in line.<br><br>By that time, they had been a couple for fifty-�six years. Together they had founded the Daughters of Bilitis, the first political organization for lesbians in the United States, and edited The Ladder, the first nationally distributed lesbian publication in the country. &#x201c;We were fighting the church, the couch, and the courts,&#x201d; Martin recalled. &#x201c;Nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner. Why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red-�blooded American woman who dares to claim it?&#x201d; Their second marriage lasted only two months; Martin died in August 2008. &#x201c;I am devastated,&#x201d; Lyon said in a statement, &#x201c;but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed.&#x201d; Seven years later, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared same-�sex marriage legal across the country, Lyon, age ninety, said, &#x201c;Well, how about that?&#x201d; She laughed and laughed. &#x201c;For goodness&#x2019; sakes.&#x201d;<br>Forugh Farrokhzad<br><br>Matron Saint of Free Voices<br><br>b. 1935, Iran<br><br>Feast Day: February 13<br><br>She was divorced and wrote about the joys of sex (&#x201c;a sin all filled with pleasure&#x201d;). She was an Iranian woman and wrote about the repression that came with that (&#x201c;Seek your rights, Sister&#x201d;). She bought cheap paper in bulk, writing thousands of lines she never published. What she did publish earned her a reputation as Iran&#x2019;s Sylvia Plath. &#x201c;I never saw her in a state of not being productive, she was like that,&#x201d; said filmmaker Ebrahim Golestan, her former lover, fifty years after her untimely death (a car accident when she was thirty-�two). Farrokhzad described her poetry as &#x201c;a vital need, a need on the scale of eating and sleeping, something like breathing.&#x201d; Born in Tehran, she traveled to Europe to &#x201c;be a woman, that is to say &#x2018;a human being.&#x2019; &#x201d; But she always came back. At the time of her death, she was planning to perform the title role in a Persian translation of George Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s Saint Joan, in Tehran. &#x201c;I love our Tehran, in spite of everything,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;I love it and it is only there that my life finds a purpose and reason . . . those heavy sunsets, those dirt roads, and those miserable miscreant corrupt people I love.&#x201d;<br>Sappho<br><br>Matron Saint of Lovers<br><br>b. 630 b.c., E., Greece<br><br>Feast Day: February 14<br><br>He seems to me an equal of the gods&#x2014;<br><br>whoever gets to sit across from you<br><br>&#x2014;Sappho, translated by Daniel Mendelsohn<br><br>Plato called her &#x201c;the Tenth Muse.&#x201d; The early church declared her &#x201c;a sex-�crazed whore who sings of her own wantonness.&#x201d; Though only a fraction of Sappho&#x2019;s lyric poetry survives today, her significance, both then and now, cannot be overestimated. In 300 b.c., King Seleucus I sent for a doctor to diagnose his son, the crown prince Antiochus. Young Antiochus&#x2019;s heartbeat was irregular, he fainted, and the color would suddenly fade from his skin. It was observed that his condition became apparent only in the presence of his stepmother, Stratonice. Thus the doctor concluded that Antiochus was suffering from erotic infatuation&#x2014;because the symptoms were &#x201c;as described by Sappho&#x201d;&#x2014;and Seleucus divorced his wife, giving way for his son to marry her.

But in the past fifteen years, a revolutionary new standard of measurement&#x2014;sabermetrics&#x2014;has been embraced by front offices in Major League Baseball and among fantasy baseball enthusiasts. But while sabermetrics is recognized as being smarter and more accurate, traditionalists, including journalists, fans, and managers, stubbornly believe that the "old" way&#x2014;a combination of outdated numbers and "gut" instinct&#x2014;is still the best way. Baseball, they argue, should be run by <em>people</em>, not by <em>numbers.</em>?</p><p>In this informative and provocative book, teh renowned ESPN analyst and senior baseball writer demolishes a century&#x2019;s worth of accepted wisdom, making the definitive case against the long-established view. Armed with concrete examples from different eras of baseball history, logic, a little math, and lively commentary, he shows how the allegiance to these numbers&#x2014;dating back to the beginning of the professional game&#x2014;is firmly rooted not in accuracy or success, but in baseball&#x2019;s irrational adherence to tradition. </p><p>While Law gores sacred cows, from clutch performers to RBIs to the infamous save rule, he also demystifies sabermetrics, explaining what these "new" numbers really are and why they&#x2019;re vital. He also considers the game&#x2019;s future, examining how teams are using Data&#x2014;from PhDs to sophisticated statistical databases&#x2014;to build future rosters; changes that will transform baseball and all of professional sports. </p></p><p><p>For the past fifteen years, many baseball fans, writers, and commentators have remained mired in the muck of old statistics&#x2014;baseball card numbers such as batting average, saves recorded, and a pitcher&#x2019;s won-lost record&#x2014;while newer, smarter, and at times counterintuitive baseball stats known as sabermetrics have become commonplace throughout Major League Baseball. Yet, despite their popularity, confusion persists about these new stats, with much of the baseball world still following the &#x201c;old&#x201d; way&#x2014;a combination of those outdated numbers and gut instinct&#x2014;to evaluate players&#x2019; contributions and careers. Baseball, they argue, should be run by people, not by numbers.</p><p>ESPN senior baseball writer Keith Law disagrees. In this provocative book, the outspoken Law takes on the established view of baseball stats, undermining over a century&#x2019;s worth of baseball dogma. With many of these numbers dating back to the beginning of the game, he examines how allegiance to these old stats is firmly rooted not in the modern game as it&#x2019;s played, but in baseball&#x2019;s irrational adherence to tradition. Law also offers a clear-eyed discussion of the new stats that are helping teams win, changing how players are valued, and altering how we talk about the game. Simplifying the math that has gotten in the way for many curious fans, he provides understandable explanations of what these numbers measure and why they work better. The end result is the essential baseball book for the modern baseball era, revealing what the rise of Big Data really means for the sport.</p><p>Keith Law is a senior baseball writer for ESPN Insider and an analyst for ESPN&#x2019;s <em>Baseball Tonight,</em> focusing on all types of baseball analysis.

Now he has an even more ambitious goal: to change the way America lives by helping Americans become fitter as well as thinner and healthier . . . for life. &nbsp; In the all-new <em>The South Beach Diet Supercharged,</em> Dr. Agatston shows you how to rev up your metabolism and<em> </em>lose weight faster while following the proven healthy eating principles of the original diet: choose good carbs, good fats, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Collaborating with Dr. Joseph Signorile, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Miami, Dr. Agatston presents a cutting-edge, three-phase workout that perfectly complements the three phases of the diet itself. Based on the latest exercise science, this ease-into-it fitness program combines low- and high-intensity interval exercise (with a focus on walking) and functional core body-toning exercises. The result: You'll look fitter and you'll burn more fat and calories all day&#x2014;even at rest. &nbsp; Also included is the latest nutritional research on how specific foods high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of phytonutrients help keep you healthy; new and expanded lists of Foods to Enjoy; taste-tempting Meal Plans for phases 1 and 2; and dozens of easy-to-prepare new recipes, including Eggs Frijoles, Chock-Full-of-Veggies Chili, Roasted Tomato Soup, Homestyle Turkey Meatloaf, and South Beach Diet Tiramisu. In every chapter you'll find inspiring success stories from real-life South Beach dieters and plenty of effective weight loss tips. And as an added bonus, Dr. Agatston answers the questions you've most often asked him about the diet since the original book was published. <p></p></p><p><p><b>Arthur Agatston</b>, M.D., is a preventive cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

He is widely published and lectures frequently on the subjects of exercise training, muscle physiology, and metabolism.</p><b>Chapter One</b> <p></p><p></p>Changing the Way America Lives <p></p><p></p>The South Beach Diet was always intended to be more than just a diet. In fact, it was originally developed to help my cardiac and diabetes patients lose weight in order to prevent heart attacks and strokes. As a cardiologist, I have always felt that the South Beach Diet is less about dieting and more about living a long, healthy, and active life. I wrote the original book in 2003 because I wanted to help change the way America eats. Now I have a new goal: I want to change the way America lives, not only by helping people eat healthfully and lose weight, if necessary, but also by helping them become more fit. We must begin to overcome the poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle that are making us fatter and sicker with each passing year. <p></p><p></p>Over the past several decades, we have witnessed an unexpected epidemic of obesity in this country. One-third of American adults over age 20 are obese, and two-thirds of us are overweight. The number of seriously overweight children has tripled. Moreover, statistics show that 51 percent of Americans don't engage in any kind of regular physical activity. The results have been catastrophic. <p></p><p></p>This epidemic of obesity is causing an array of health problems that is much broader than we doctors ever imagined. Beyond the cosmetic concerns that pervade our culture, the list of real problems arising from our toxic lifestyle is getting ever longer. A partial list includes&#x2014;and you may want to sit down for this&#x2014;heart attack, stroke, prediabetes, diabetes, many types of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration, arthritis, osteoporosis, psoriasis, acne, depression, and attention deficit disorders. And this is just a sampling. <p></p><p></p>It also appears that if we do not reverse the health course that we are on, the cost in human and economic terms will reach crisis proportions. Our poor diet and sedentary lifestyle are already exacting a steep toll in terms of mortality and money. They're responsible for an estimated 300,000 premature deaths every year and $90 billion in health-care costs, but I believe the real costs are much higher. And as the baby boom generation gets older, these health costs will likely continue to soar. <p></p><p></p>Sadly, this is not only an American problem. Just as our sedentary, fastfood lifestyle is being exported around the world, so are the attendant health problems. The good news is that now that we better understand what's happening to us, we can start to create solutions. <p></p><p></p>A Sedentary Nation <p></p><p></p>In order to develop strategies to halt and reverse the epidemic of obesity, we must be aware of the trends that have gradually but inexorably brought us to the crisis situation we are in today. I have found in my practice that by putting patients' current problems into a context they can understand, they can more easily become cooperative partners in moving toward solutions. Perhaps because I was a history major (not all doctors are bio majors), I also find that tracing today's health problems back to their original roots is fascinating. <p></p><p></p>The truth is that while our bad diet and unhealthy lifestyle have been many decades in the making, the toxic changes in the way we live have really accelerated in recent years. Our DNA is designed to live, eat, and exercise the way our hunter-gatherer ancestors did, and it hasn't changed substantially since that time. But we no longer live in the wild. We don't have famine in this country to keep us thin. We no longer burn calories hunting and gathering our food. <p></p><p></p>On top of that, a completely sedentary lifestyle has gradually crept in, invention by incredible invention. Due to the march of technology, we sit in front of computers both at work and at home. Machines and gadgets lift, move, and carry things for us. We communicate by e-mail, and many of us don't even walk down the hall to chat with colleagues as often as we used to! While studies document how much less physical exertion we're doing, we really don't need research studies to appreciate the trend. All we have to do is look around. <p></p><p></p>The preponderance of labor-saving devices, from tractors and forklifts to remote controls and the personal computer, has had a major impact on the number of calories we expend daily at home and at work. These devices have also had devastating effects on our muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments. Sitting bent over at a computer for most of the day is simply not good for our health. In Chapter 5, "Boomeritis: The New Epidemic!" I talk about these evolving physical problems and their solutions. And in Part II of the book, I present the South Beach Supercharged Fitness Program. Not only will this 20-minute-a-day program help you burn more calories even when you're not working out, it will also strengthen the key core muscles in your abdomen, back, pelvis, and hips. It's your core muscles that help you avoid the back pain and other muscle problems that so often result from our sedentary lives. <p></p><p></p>Missing Our Nutrients <p></p><p></p>Our unhealthy lifestyle is made even worse by our poor diet. Since we began growing fields of grain about 10,000 years ago and developed the ability to cultivate fruits and vegetables, the nutritional content of our foods has seriously deteriorated. This is because we tend to breed plants for hardiness, taste, and aesthetics, not nutrients. Today, the fruits and vegetables we find in most supermarkets are larger, sweeter, and better-looking than those our ancestors gathered. The problem is that they also have less fiber and fewer vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients than is optimal for our general health&#x2014;not to mention our waistlines. Luckily, more and more Americans are embracing organic foods, heirloom fruits and vegetables, and sustainable farming methods, all trends that are bringing food back to its more natural and nutritious state. In Chapter 7, "Supercharged Foods for Better Health," I recommend some foods with powerful nutritional benefits that can help you stay healthy and avoid the host of chronic and degenerative diseases currently affecting so many of us. <p></p><p></p>A Nation Overprocessed <p></p><p></p>Beyond our desire to cultivate and produce food almost exclusively to please our tastebuds, other social and technological trends have affected our food supply for the worse. A few generations ago, our great grandparents walked to local markets on a daily basis to buy whatever produce they didn't grow themselves as well as fresh bread and other food for their families' next meals. They could only travel to local markets and take home what they were able to carry. With the advent of the automobile and the home refrigerator, however, it became possible to travel farther to shop, and people could take home enough food to feed their families for a week or two. But for that to be possible, foods had to have longer shelf lives. This led to supermarkets and to food processing, which, unfortunately, removed important nutrients while adding substances like sodium and trans fats to prevent spoilage. In a sense, we began digesting our food in factories instead of in our intestines. <p></p><p></p>It's only now that we are appreciating the deleterious effects these technological "advances" have had on our weight and on our health. In Chapter 3, "A Diet You Can Live With . . . For Life," I discuss the health and character of a Mediterranean society that thrived without many of our modern advances, and I show you how we can learn from this remarkable example. <p></p><p></p>We Must Act Now <p></p><p></p>If you're like me, you find how we got into this sad state not only depressing but scary. But there is hope if we take action today. Because we finally understand so much of what has gone wrong, we can use our advanced technologies to turn things around. We now know that our increasing waistlines, poor physical fitness, and worsening health are not different It was 2003, and my husband had very high blood pressure that wasn't being controlled, even with medication. I was very overweight and knew that we both needed to make a change. The South Beach Diet had just come out, and I went to the bookstore to look over a copy. The first thing I turned to was the recipe section. It was great. I love to cook and was thrilled that I didn't have to give it up. <p></p><p></p>After reading the book, I realized that I ate way too many bad carbs all day, like crackers and cookies. Once I stopped eating enriched white flour, I noticed a complete change in everything about me, including my mood and energy level, and I started losing weight. Within a year, I lost 45 pounds, and my husband lost 20. Although he still takes medication for high blood pressure, it's now under control. <p></p><p></p>Now I'm the go-to girl at work for healthy-food questions. When we have luncheons, everyone knows they can count on me to bring in something healthy. I have learned how to take bad carbs out of a recipe and replace them with good carbs. I am passionate about telling people to read food labels! Don't be fooled; buy only whole-grain products. If it says "enriched white flour," find something else. <p></p><p></p>In 2005, we had an 11-year-old foster youth come to live with us. He was overweight and already taking medication for high blood pressure. He lived on junk food. We took him to a doctor, who told us that he shouldn't go on a diet&#x2014;he should start living a healthy lifestyle. I decided to give him the same healthy food my husband and I were eating, but I told him he could eat as much as he wanted. He also started exercising. Simply by eating the right foods and being more active, he started losing weight fairly quickly. By the end of 4 months, he was off the blood pressure medication, and by the time he left us 18 months later, he had lost 30 pounds. While living with us, he learned how to read food labels and make good food choices. I hope he continues to live a healthy life. My husband often jokes that I should open my home to people who want to lose weight....</p><h2>The Richest Man in Babylon: Six Laws of Wealth</h2><p><p>For decades, people have turned to the story of The Richest Man in Babylon to learn the fundamentals of finance.

The comprehensive book covers anatomical and emotional changes, reproduction as a biological process, sex, masturbation, dating, and some of the emotional differences between boys and girls. Other gender-specific topics are also included. The information is presented in a friendly, compassionate manner, and the book is a great way to start a conversation with preteens or tweens.

Instead of generic fights, Wheeler offers, in rhyme, six matches featuring various wresting styles: folk style, lucha libre, Greco-Roman, sumo, freestyle, and pro tag team. She offers salient facts about each style and the culture that developed it and identifies each of the dino-combatants by their scientific names, all while wrapping the education in clever humor (the T. rex's tiny arms, for instance, leave him outmatched in Greco-Roman wrestling, in which the use of legs is barred). Gott's cuddly style does not stop him from producing anatomically identifiable dinosaurs, allowing young experts to root for their favorites, and he tops it off by including accurate wrestling moves for each of the matches, from the tight grappling of folk style to the wild brawling of pro tag team. <strong>Many a little reader will do a victory dance in the stacks for this combination of dinosaurs and hand-to-hand combat.</strong>" &#x2015;Booklist Online</p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"Wheeler, that rhyming dino-sports enthusiast, is back, this time with a survey of wrestling styles.<br> <br> Leaving no mat unexplored, this encompasses everything from folkstyle wrestling to Greco-Roman and sumo and everything in between. <strong>Combining spot-on rhythms and rhymes with a narrative style that is akin to a sports announcer, the verses fly by as the dinosaurs gather to watch and participate in the Dino-Wrestling Jamboree.</strong> Each style of wrestling gets its own match, with the text often telling a bit about the style, its rules and/or its equipment. During the lucha libre event, the verse even includes a few Spanish vocabulary words, though, as with other wrestling terms, they are not defined in context: 'The crowd goes loco&#x2015;shouts and boos. / Ouch! That hit will leave a bruise.' Every detail is in Gott's brightly colored cartoon illustrations&#x2015;from the different uniforms the participants wear down to the little guy who holds the sign up with the dinosaurs' species (handy, since Wheeler often shortens them) and wrestling style.

Many of the styles are probably unfamiliar to children, but not for long. <strong>The illustrations do a great job of depicting wrestling moves, the action in general, and spot-on facial expressions. </strong>As each event progresses, the naughty but amusing Pterodactyl Twins inevitably show up: 'But this is not the Twins' event./Security throws them out the tent!' When the Twins' turn finally arrives, it's the pro tag team event, and they are 'Ready to Rumble.' In an homage to the WWF of the 1980s, it ends in a free-for-all that causes the tent to fall down. The rhyming text is fun to read with the dinosaurs' names in bold font in either red or green depending on their dining preference (carnivore = red, herbivore = green).

She lives in Miami.</p>Part One<br> Claire of the Sea Light <br> &nbsp;<br> The morning Claire Limy� Lanm� Faustin turned seven, a freak wave, measuring between ten and twelve feet high, was seen in the ocean outside of Ville Rose. Claire&#x2019;s father, Nozias, a fisherman, was one of many who saw it in the distance as he walked toward his sloop. He first heard a low rumbling, like that of distant thunder, then saw a wall of water rise from the depths of the ocean, a giant blue-green tongue, trying, it seemed, to lick a pink sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as quickly as it had swelled, the wave cracked. Its barrel collapsed, pummeling a cutter called <i>Fifine</i>, sinking it and Caleb, the sole fisherman onboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias ran to the edge of the water, wading in to where the tide reached his knees. Lost now was a good friend, whom Nozias had greeted for years as they walked past each other, before dawn, on their way out to sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dozen or so other fishermen were already standing next to Nozias. He looked down the beach at Caleb&#x2019;s shack, where Caleb&#x2019;s wife, Fifine&#x2014;Josephine&#x2014;had probably returned to bed after seeing him off. Nozias knew from his experience, and could sense it in his bones, that both Caleb and the boat were gone. They might wash up in a day or two, or more likely they never would.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a sweltering Saturday morning in the first week of May. Nozias had slept in longer than usual, contemplating the impossible decision he&#x2019;d always known that he would one day have to make: to whom, finally, to give his daughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Woke up earlier and I would have been there,&#x201d; he ran back home and tearfully told his little girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> Claire was still lying on a cot in their single-room shack. The back of her thin nightdress was soaked with sweat. She wrapped her long, molasses-colored arms around Nozias&#x2019;s neck, just as she had when she was even littler, pressing her nose against his cheek. Some years before, Nozias had told her what had happened on her first day on earth, that giving birth to her, her mother had died. So her birthday was also a day of death, and the freak wave and the dead fisherman proved that it had never ceased to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The day Claire Limy� Lanm� turned six was also the day Ville Rose&#x2019;s undertaker, Albert Vincent, was inaugurated as the new mayor. He kept both positions, leading to all kinds of jokes about the town eventually becoming a cemetery so he could get more clients. Albert was a man of unmatched elegance, even though he had shaky hands. He wore a beige two-piece suit every day, just as he did on the day of his inauguration. His eyes, people said, had not always been the lavender color that they were now. Their clouding, sad but gorgeous, was owing to the sun and early-onset cataracts. On the day of his swearing-in, Albert, shaking hands and all, recited from memory a speech about the town&#x2019;s history. He did this from the top step of the town hall, a white nineteenth century gingerbread that overlooked a flamboyant-filled piazza, where hundreds of residents stood elbow to elbow in the afternoon sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ville Rose was home to about eleven thousand people, five percent of them wealthy or comfortable. The rest were poor, some dirt-poor. Many were out of work, but some were farmers or fishermen (some both) or seasonal sugarcane workers. Twenty miles south of the capital and crammed between a stretch of the most unpredictable waters of the Caribbean Sea and an eroded Haitian mountain range, the town had a flower-shaped perimeter that, from the mountains, looked like the unfurling petals of a massive tropical rose, so the major road connecting the town to the sea became the stem and was called Avenue Pied Rose or Stem Rose Avenue, with its many alleys and capillaries being called �pines, or thorns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Albert Vincent&#x2019;s victory rally was held at the town&#x2019;s center&#x2014;the ovule of the rose&#x2014;across from Sainte Rose de Lima Cathedral, which had been repainted a deeper lilac for the inauguration. Albert offered his inaugural address while covering his hands with a black fedora that few had ever seen on his head. On the edge of the crowd, perched on Nozias&#x2019;s shoulder, Claire Limy� Lanm� was wearing her pink muslin birthday dress, her plaited hair covered with tiny bow shaped barrettes. At some point, Claire noticed that she and her father were standing next to a plump woman with a cherubic face framed with a long, straight hairpiece. The woman was wearing black pants and a black blouse and had a white hibiscus pinned behind her ear. She owned Ville Rose&#x2019;s only fabric shop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you for putting your trust in me,&#x201d; Albert Vincent now boomed into the crowd. The speech was at last winding down nearly a half hour after he&#x2019;d begun speaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias cupped his hands over his mouth as he whispered something in the fabric vendor&#x2019;s ear. It was obvious to Claire that her father had not really come to hear the mayor, but to see the fabric vendor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later that same evening, the fabric vendor appeared at the shack near the end of Pied Rose Avenue. Claire was expecting to be sent to a neighbor while the fabric vendor stayed alone with her father, but Nozias had insisted that Claire pat her hair down with an old bristle brush and that she straighten out the creases on the ruffled dress that she&#x2019;d kept on all day despite the heat and sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing between Nozias&#x2019;s and Claire&#x2019;s cots in the middle of the shack, the fabric vendor asked Claire to twirl by the light of the kerosene lamp, which was in its usual place on the small table where Claire and Nozias sometimes ate their meals. The walls of the shack were covered with flaking, yellowed copies of <i>La Rosette, </i>the town&#x2019;s newspaper, which had been glued to the wood long ago with manioc paste by Claire&#x2019;s mother. From where she was standing, Claire could see her own stretched-out shadow moving along with the others over the fading words. While twirling for the lady, Claire heard her father say, &#x201c;I am for correcting children, but I am not for whipping.&#x201d; He looked down at Claire and paused. His voice cracked, and he jabbed his thumb into the middle of his palm as he continued. &#x201c;I am for keeping her clean, as you can see. She should of course continue with her schooling, be brought as soon as possible to a doctor when she is sick.&#x201d; Still jabbing at his palm, after having now switched palms, he added, &#x201c;In turn, she would help with some cleaning both at home and at the shop.&#x201d; Only then did Claire realize who this &#x201c;her&#x201d; was that they were talking about, and that her father was trying to give her away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her legs suddenly felt like lead, and she stopped twirling, and as soon as she stopped, the fabric vendor turned to her father, her fake hair blocking half of her face. Nozias&#x2019;s eyes dropped from the fabric vendor&#x2019;s fancy hairpiece to her pricey open-toed sandals and red toenails.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; the fabric vendor said, as she headed for the narrow doorway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias seemed stunned, drawing a long breath and letting it out slowly before following the fabric vendor to the door. They thought they were whispering, but Claire could hear them clearly from across the room. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going away,&#x201d; Nozias said. &#x201c;Pou ch�che lavi, to look for a better life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ohmm.&#x201d; The fabric vendor groaned a warning, like an impossible word, a word she had no idea how to say. &#x201c;Why would you want your child to be my servant, a restav�k?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know she would never be that with you,&#x201d; Nozias said. &#x201c;But this is what would happen anyway, with less kind people than you if I die. I don&#x2019;t have any more family here in town.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nozias put an end to the fabric vendor&#x2019;s questioning by making a joke about the undertaker&#x2019;s mayoral victory and how many meaningless speeches he would be forced to endure if he remained in Ville Rose. This made the fabric vendor&#x2019;s jingly laugh sound as though it were coming out of her nose. The good news, Claire thought, was that her father did not try to give her away every day. Most of the time, he acted as though he would always keep her. During the week, Claire went to the �cole Ardin, where she received a charity scholarship from the schoolmaster himself, Msye Ardin. And at night, Claire would sit by the kerosene lamp at the small table in the middle of the shack and recite the new words she was learning. Nozias enjoyed the singsong and her hard work and missed it during her holidays from school. The rest of the time, he went out to sea at the crack of dawn and always came back with some cornmeal or eggs, which he&#x2019;d bartered part of his early-morning catch for. He talked about going to work in construction or the fishing trade in the neighboring Dominican Republic, but he would always make it sound as though it were something he and Claire could do together, not something he&#x2019;d have to abandon her to do. But as soon as her birthday came, he would begin talking about it again&#x2014; ch�che lavi: going away to make a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lap�ch, fishing, was no longer as profitable as it had once been, she would hear him tell anyone who would listen. It was no longer like in the old days, when he and his friends would put a net in the water for an hour or so, then pull it out full of big, mature fish. Now they had to leave nets in for half a day or longer, and they would pull fish out of the sea that were so small that in the old days they would have been thrown back. But now you had to do with what you got; even if you knew deep in your gut that it was wrong, for example, to keep baby conch shells or lobsters full of eggs, you had no choice but to do it. You could no longer afford to fish in season, to let the sea replenish itself. You had to go out nearly every day, even on Fridays, and even as the seabed was disappearing, and the sea grass that used to nourish the fish was buried under silt and trash.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he was not talking to the fabric vendor about fishing that night. They were talking about Claire. His relatives and his dead wife&#x2019;s relatives, who lived in the villages in the surrounding mountains where he was born, were even poorer than he was, he was saying. If he died, sure they would take Claire, but only because they had no choice, because that&#x2019;s what families do, because no matter what, f�k nou voye je youn sou l�t. We must all look after one another. But he was being careful, he said. He didn&#x2019;t want to leave something as crucial as his daughter&#x2019;s future to chance. <br> &nbsp;<br> After the fabric vendor left, colorful sparks rose up from the hills and filled the night sky over the homes near the lighthouse, in the Anth�re (anther) section of town. Beyond the lighthouse, the hills turned into a mountain, wild and green, and mostly unexplored because the ferns there bore no fruit. The wood was too wet for charcoal and too unsteady for construction. People called this mountain M�n Initil, or Useless Mountain, because there was little there that they wanted. It was also believed to be haunted.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fireworks illuminated the mushroom-shaped tops of the ferns of M�n Initil as well as the gated two-story mansions of Anth�re Hill. They also illuminated the clapboard shacks by the sea and their thatched and tin roofs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once the fabric vendor was gone, Claire and her father rushed out to see the lights exploding in the sky. The alleys between the shacks were jam-packed with their neighbors. With cannonlike explosions, Albert Vincent, the undertaker turned mayor, was celebrating his victory. But as her neighbors clapped in celebration, Claire couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like she was the one who&#x2019;d won. The fabric vendor had said no and she would get to stay with her father another year. <br></p><h2>Kid Sheriff and the Terrible Toads</h2><p><p>Drywater Gulch has a toad problem.

Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan, had expanded his empire from western Asia to southeastern Europe and North Africa. To secure control of the Mediterranean between these territories and launch an offensive into western Europe, Suleiman needed the small but strategically crucial island of Malta. But Suleiman&#x2019;s attempt to take the island from the Holy Roman Empire&#x2019;s Knights of St. John would emerge as one of the most famous and brutal military defeats in history.<br><br> Forty-two years earlier, Suleiman had been victorious against the Knights of St. John when he drove them out of their island fortress at Rhodes. Believing he would repeat this victory, the sultan sent an armada to Malta. When they captured Fort St. Elmo, the Ottoman forces ruthlessly took no prisoners. The Roman grand master La Vallette responded by having his Ottoman captives beheaded. Then the battle for Malta began in earnest: no quarter asked, none given.<br><br> Ernle Bradford&#x2019;s compelling and thoroughly researched account of the Great Siege of Malta recalls not just an epic battle, but a clash of civilizations unlike anything since the time of Alexander the Great. It is &#x201c;a superior, readable treatment of an important but little-discussed epic from the Renaissance past .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Bradford was an enthusiastic sailor himself and spent almost thirty years sailing the Mediterranean, where many of his books are set. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II, finishing as the first lieutenant of a destroyer. Bradford lived in Malta for a number of years. He did occasional broadcast work for the BBC, was a magazine editor, and wrote many books, including&nbsp;<i>Hannibal</i>,&nbsp;<i>Paul the Traveller</i>,&nbsp;<i>Julius Caesar: The Pursuit of Power</i>,&nbsp;<i>Christopher Columbus</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Mighty Hood.</i><br>''A superior, readable treatment of an important but little-discussed epic from the Renaissance past . . .

Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs quickly take the case. Curiously, the killer has left behind a half-million dollars' worth of gems at the murder scene, a jewelry store on 47th street. As more crimes follow, it becomes clear that the killer's target is not gems, but engaged couples themselves. <br> The Promisor vows to take the lives of men and women during their most precious moments--midway through the purchase of an engagement ring, after a meeting with a wedding planner, trying on the perfect gown for a day that will never come. The Promisor arrives silently, armed with knife or gun, and a time of bliss is transformed, in an instant, to one of horror. <br> Soon the Promiser makes a dangerous mistake: leaving behind an innocent witness, Vimal Lahori, a talented young diamond cutter, who can help Rhyme and Sachs blow the lid off the case. They must track down Vimal before the killer can correct his fatal error. Then disaster strikes, threatening to tear apart the very fabric of the city--and providing the perfect cover for the killer to slip through the cracks. <br></p><p>Jeffery Deaver is the #1 international bestselling author of more than thirty novels, three collections of short stories, and a nonfiction law book.

The quantitative nature of complex financial transactions makes them a fascinating subject area for mathematicians of all types, whether for general interest or because of the enormous monetary rewards on offer. <br><br>An Introduction to Quantitative Finance concerns financial derivatives a derivative being a contract between two entities whose value derives from the price of an underlying financial asset and the probabilistic tools that were developed to analyse them. The theory in the text is motivated by a desire to provide a suitably rigorous yet accessible foundation to tackle problems the author encountered whilst trading derivatives on Wall Street. The book combines an unusual blend of real world derivatives trading experience and rigorous academic background. <br><br>Probability provides the key tools for analysing and valuing derivatives. The price of a derivative is closely linked to the expected value of its pay out, and suitably scaled derivative prices are martingales, fundamentally important objects in probability theory. <br><br>The prerequisite for mastering the material is an introductory undergraduate course in probability. The book is otherwise self contained and in particular requires no additional preparation or exposure to finance. It is suitable for a one semester course, quickly exposing readers to powerful theory and substantive problems. The book may also appeal to students who have enjoyed probability and have a desire to see how it can be applied. Signposts are given throughout the text to more advanced topics and to different approaches for those looking to take the subject further.<br></p><p><br>Stephen Blyth, <em>Professor of the Practice of Statistics and Managing Director of Harvard Management Company, Harvard University</em><br><br>Stephen Blyth is managing director and head of public markets at the Harvard Management Company, the subsidiary of Harvard University responsible for the management of the University's endowment.

I wish merely to explain the history of my Project, the scope and plan of this work, and the objects I have held in view. </p><p>In separate introductory Notes I have mentioned the useful books to which I have referred, under the headings: Commentaries on the Qur'an; Translations of the Qur'an; and Useful Works of Reference. I have similarly explained the system, which I have followed in the Transliteration of Arabic Words and Names; the Abbreviations I have used; and the Principal Divisions of the Qur'an. </p><p>It may be asked: Is there any need for a fresh English Translation? To those who ask this question I commend a careful consideration of the facts, which I have set out in my note on Translations of the Qur'an. After they have read it, I would invite them to take any particular passage say 2:74, or 2:102, or 2:164 and compare it with any previous version they choose. If they find that I have helped them even the least bit further in understanding its meaning, or appreciating its beauty, or catching something of the grandeur of the original, I would claim that my humble attempt is justified. </p><p>It is the duty of every Muslim-man, woman, or child-to read the Qur'an and understand it according to his own capacity. If anyone of us attains to some knowledge or understanding of it by study, contemplation, and the test of life, both outward and inward, it is his duty, according to his capacity, to instruct others, and share with them the joy and peace which result from contact with the spiritual world. The Qur'an-indeed every religious book-has to be read, not only with the tongue and voice and eyes, but with the best light that our intellect can supply, and even more, with the truest and purest light which our heart and conscience can give us. It is in this spirit that I would have my readers approach the Qur'an. </p><p>It was between the ages of four and five that I first learned to read its Arabic words, to revel in its rhythm and music, and wonder at its meaning. I have a dim recollection of the khatm ceremony which closed that stage. It was called "completion": it really just began a spiritual awakening that has gone on ever since. My revered father taught me Arabic, but I must have imbibed from him into my innermost being something more, something which told me that all the world's thoughts, all the world's most beautiful languages and literatures, are but vehicles for that ineffable message which comes to the heart in rare moments of ecstasy. The soul of mysticism and ecstasy is in the Qur'an, as well as the plain guidance for the plain man, which a world in a hurry affects to consider as sufficient. It is good to make this personal confession, to an age in which it is in the highest degree unfashionable to speak of religion or spiritual peace or consolation, an age in which words like these draw forth only derision, pity, or contempt. </p><p>I have explored Western lands, Western manners, and the depths of Western thought and Western learning, to an extent, which has rarely fallen to the lot of an Eastern mortal. But I have never lost touch with my Eastern heritage. Through all my successes and failures, I have learned to rely more and more upon the one true thing in all life-the voice that speaks in a tongue above that of mortal man. For me the embodiment of that voice has been in the noble words of the Arabic Qur'an, which I have tried to translate for myself and apply to my experience repeatedly. The service of the Qur'an has been the pride and the privilege of many Muslims. I felt that with such life-experience as has fallen to my lot, my service to the Qur'an should be to present it in a fitting garb in English. That ambition I have cherished in my mind for more than forty years. I have collected books and materials for it. I have visited places, undertaken journeys, taken notes, sought the society of men, and tried to explore their thoughts and hearts, in order to equip myself for the task. Sometimes I have considered it too stupendous for me-the double task of understanding the original, and reproducing its nobility, its beauty, its poetry, its grandeur, and its sweet practical reasonable application to everyday experience. Then I have blamed myself for lack of courage-the spiritual courage of men who dared all in the Cause, which was so dear to them. </p><p>Two sets of apparently accidental circumstances at last decided me. A man's life is subject to inner storms far more devastating than those in the physical world around him. In such a storm, in the bitter anguish of a personal sorrow which nearly unseated my reason and made life seem meaningless, a new hope was born out of a systematic pursuit of my long-cherished project. Watered by tears, my manuscript began to grow in depth and earnestness if not in bulk. I guarded it like a secret treasure. Wanderer that l am, I carried it about, thousands of miles, to all sorts of countries and among all sorts of people. At length, in the city of Lahore, I happened to mention the matter to some young people who held me in respect and affection. They showed an enthusiasm and an eagerness which surprised me. They almost took the matter out of my hands. They asked for immediate publication. I had various bits ready, but not even one complete Siparah (Juz&#x2019; (1/30 of the Qur&#x2019;an) )*. They made me promise to complete at least one Siparah* before I left Lahore. As if by magic, a publisher, a katib (calligraphist to write the Arabic Text), an engraver of blocks for such text, a printer were found, all equally anxious to push forward the scheme. Blessed be youth, for its energy and determination. "Where others flinch, rash youth will dare!"</p>Gentle and discerning reader! what I wish to present to you is an English Interpretation, side by side with the Arabic Text. The English shall be, not a mere substitution of one word for another, but the best expression I can give to the fullest meaning which I can understand from the Arabic Text. The rhythm, music, and exalted tone of the original should be reflected in the English Interpretation. It may be but a faint reflection, but such beauty and power as my pen can command shall be brought to its service. I want to make English itself an Islamic language, if such a person as I can do it. And I must give you all the accessory aid which I can. In rhythmic prose, or free verse (whichever you like to call it), I prepare the atmosphere for you in a running Commentary. Introducing the subject generally, I come to the actual Surahs. Where they are short, I give you one or two paragraphs of my rhythmic Commentary to prepare you for the Text. Where the Surah is long, ! <p>I introduce the subject matter in short appropriate paragraphs of the Commentary from time to time, each indicating the particular verses to which it refers. The paragraphs of the running Commentary are numbered consecutively, with some regard to the connection with the preceding and the following paragraphs. It is possible to read this running rhythmic Commentary by itself to get a general bird's-eye view of the contents of the Holy Book before you proceed to the study of the Book itself. </p><p>It is important that at least in lslamic countries one system of numbering should be adopted. I have adopted mainly that of the Egyptian edition published under the authority of the King of Egypt. This will probably be accepted in Egypt and in Arabic-speaking countries, as those countries generally look up to Egypt in matters of literature. I am glad to see that the text shortly to be published by the Anjumani Himayati Islam of Lahore is following the same system of numbering. I recommend to other publishers in India the same good example. If once this is done we shall have a uniform system of numbering. I have retained the numbering of Sections, as it is universally used in the Arabic copies, and marks a logical division of the Surahs. I have supplied a further aid to the reader in indicating subdivision of the Sections into paragraphs. They are not numbered, but are distinguished by the use of a flowery initial letter. </p><p>In translating the Text I have aired no views of my own, but followed the received Commentators. Where they differ among themselves, I have had to choose what appeared to me to be the most reasonable opinion from all points of view. Where it is a question merely of words, I have not considered the question important enough to discuss in the Notes, but where it is a question of substance, I hope adequate explanations will be found in the Notes. Where I have departed from the literal translation in order to express the spirit of the original better in English, I have explained the literal meaning in the Notes. For example, see 2:104 n. and 2:26 n. In choosing an English word for an Arabic word, a translator necessarily exercises his own judgment and may be unconsciously expressing a point of view, but that is inevitable. </p><p>Let me explain the scope of the Notes. I have made them as short as possible consistently with the object I have in view, viz., to give to the English reader, scholar as well as general reader, a fairly complete but concise view of what I understand to be the meaning of the Text. To discuss theological controversies or enter into polemical arguments I have considered outside my scope. Such discussions and arguments may be necessary and valuable, but they should find a place in separate treatises, if only out of respect to the Holy Book. Besides, such discussions leave no room for more important matters on which present-day readers desire information. In this respect, our Commentators have not always been discreet. On questions of law, the Qur'an lays down general principles, and these I have explained. I have avoided technical details: these will be found discussed in their proper place in my book on "Anglo-Muhammadan Law". Nor have I devoted much space to grammatical or philological Notes. On these points, I consider that the labors of the vast body of our learned men in the past have left little new to say now. There is usually not much controversy, and I have accepted their conclusions without setting out the reasons for them. Where it has been necessary for the understanding of the Text to refer to the particular occasion for the revelation of a particular verse, I have done so briefly, but have not allowed it to absorb a disproportionate amount of space. It will be found that every verse revealed for a particular occasion has also a general meaning. The particular occasion and the particular people concerned have passed away, but the general meaning and its application remain true for all time. What we are concerned about now, in the fourteenth century of the Hijrah, is: what guidance can we draw for ourselves from the message of Allah? </p><p>I spoke of the general meaning of the verses. Every earnest and reverent student of the Qur'an, as he proceeds with his study, will find, with an inward joy difficult to describe, how this general meaning also enlarges as his own capacity for understanding increases. It is like a traveler climbing a mountain: the higher he goes, the farther he sees. From a literary point of view, the poet Keats has described his feeling when he discovered Chapman's Homer: </p><p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies <br>When anew planet swims into his ken, <br>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes <br>He stared at the Pacific-and all his men <br>Looked at each other with a wild surmise <br>Silent, upon a peak in Darien. </p><p>How much greater is the joy and sense of wonder and miracle when the Qur'an opens our spiritual eyes! The meaning which we thought we had grasped expands. New worlds are opened out. As we progress, still newer, and again newer worlds "swim into our ken". The miracle deepens and deepens, and almost completely absorbs us. And yet we know that the "face of Allah "our final goal-has not yet been reached. We are in the mulk of Sulayman (2:102), which the evil ones denied, belied, and even turned into blasphemy. But we can ignore blasphemy, ridicule and contempt, for we are on the threshold of Realities, and a little perfume from the garden of the Holy One has already gladdened our nostrils. </p><p>Such meaning it is most difficult to express. But where I can, I have indicated it in the Notes, in the Commentary, and with the help of the rhythm and the elevated language of the Text. </p><p>One final word to my readers. Read, study, and digest the Holy Book. Read slowly, and let it sink into your heart and soul. Such study will, like virtue, be its own reward. If you find anything in this volume to criticize, please let it not spoil your enjoyment of the rest. If you write to me, quoting chapter and verse, I shall be glad to consider your criticism, but let it not vex you if I exercise my own judgment in deciding for myself. Any corrections accepted will be gratefully acknowledged. On the other hand, if there is something that specially pleases you or helps you, please do not hesitate to write to me. I have given you other interests to help you. It will be a pleasure to know that my labor has not been in vain. If you address me in care of my Publisher at his Lahore address, he will always forward the letters to me. </p><p>A.

But the witty writer was flabbergasted by the response when over 10,000 readers voted. &#34;I have never written a column that got a bigger response than the one announcing the Bad Song Survey,&#34; Barry wrote.Based on the results of the survey, Dave Barry&#39;s Book of Bad Songs is a compilation of some of the worst songs ever written. Dave Barry fans will relish his quirky take. Music buffs, too will appreciate this humorous stroll through the world&#39;s worst lyrics. The only thing wrong with this book is that readers will find themselves unable to stop mentally singing the greatest hits of Gary Puckett.</p><p>Dave Barry, that indefatigable yukmeister, writes terrific humor columns (never mind that they all begin to sound the same if you read him regularly). He's the funniest friend you never had. If you read his column--better yet, if you don't read his column--get your hands on a copy of <i>The Book of Bad Songs.</i> <p> Barry's style is so effortless that you can't resist quoting him. This bit is from his mock-hortatory introduction: "If you keep reading, you're going to have all kinds of bad songs waking up and creeping around inside your brain, refusing to die, just like the corpses in the movie <i>The Night of the Living Dead</i> ..."</p>Dave Barry is the author of many bestsellers including <i>Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys</i>, <i>Dave Barry Turns 40</i> and <i>Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up</i>.

Hinckley provides his readers with a game plan for discovering and embracing the things in life that are valuable and worthwhile. He shows how our lives are shaped by the decisions we make every day about personal behavior -- and he shows how to make the right decisions with the help of nine guiding principles. <br> With its vivid anecdotes, invaluable precepts, and timeless wisdom, <i>Way to Be!</i> will be a source of both inspiration and practical advice for young people everywhere who want to lead better, fuller, more satisfying lives.</p><p><b>Gordon B. Hinckley</b> is the world leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which he was ordained the fifteenth President in 1995. he and his wife, Marjorie Pay Hinckley, live in Salt Lake City and have five children.The nonagenarian president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints offers young adults optimistic, down-to-earth advice in this inspirational gift book. In short chapters that are especially directed at teens, Hinckley presents "nine suggestions gleaned from more than nine decades of living": young people should be grateful, smart, involved, clean, true, positive, humble, still and prayerful. The tone will be familiar to those who enjoyed Hinckley's 2000 book Standing for Something: Ten Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and Homes; even the virtues themselves are very similar. As before, Hinckley shares simple but meaningful stories from his own life, concentrating mostly here on anecdotes from his childhood on a fruit farm. Although Hinckley's chief role is as a Mormon prophet, his folksy advice is virtually indistinguishable from that found in other Christian self-help books: he lauds Jesus Christ as "the Savior, who is the perfect example in all things," discusses the importance of not taking the Lord's name in vain and argues for daily prayer. He also adopts conservative stands on social issues, eschewing pornography, tattoos, drugs and premarital sex. Some readers may wish for more, since the book feels a bit thin on the ground; young women, also, may wish that Hinckley had more consistently employed gender-inclusive language. In all, however, this heartfelt, homespun primer on spiritual values is well crafted for its intended audience of young Christians, Mormon or otherwise.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Twelve Laws of Life Recovery: Wisdom for Your Journey</h2><p>As you work toward life recovery, some days feel more difficult than others . . . and you may yearn for guidance and structure as you seek to rebuild your character.

Reprint.</p><p>Lynn Plourde is the author of forty children&#x2019;s books, including&nbsp;<i>Wild Child</i>;&nbsp;<i>Wake Up, Baby Bear!</i>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Maxi&#x2019;s Secrets.&nbsp;</i>She often makes author visits to schools, teaching students how to write their own stories. Lynn lives in Maine where she adores being an on-the-go grandma to her grandson. You can visit her online at LynnPlourde.com.The bouncing, methodical rhyme scheme that served Plourde well in her humorous Pig in the Mud in the Middle of the Rud and her recent Moose, of Course! works against the theme in this bedtime book. As Mother Earth repeatedly tries to put her daughter to sleep, she's met with the same reply, " 'Not for a while,' said her wild child," who comes up with a variety of stalling tactics, including a song, a snack and, of course, a kiss goodnight. Each spread offers a number of clues as to the wild child's identity, most of which are smoothly integrated into Couch's (Moonball) artwork. While he keeps the girl visibly human in face and stature, fall leaves make up her hair; and hills, streams and stones comprise Mother Earth's beautifully sensuous lines and curves as she gives her daughter the gifts of the season (e.g., a snack of "Crunchy, munchy,/ chewy chestnuts./ Plumpy, lumpy,/ pulpy pumpkins"). His subtle brushwork and golden palette convey a dusk slowly metamorphosing to nightfall. Unfortunately, the jarring closing lines, which describe the mother's kiss, end the book on an eerie note: "A gusty, blustery, twisty embrace./ A crystalish, icicle-ish,/ icebergy kiss." Couch's artwork, showing Mother Earth tucking the girl (revealed to be Autumn) into bed, softens the imagery, but readers may well be put off by the cool language for a ritual usually characterized by warmth.

The closest witnesses to the event are the tourists who had been browsing the fake designer handbags that the man was selling. The dead man is one of the many African immigrants purveying goods outside normal shop hours and trading without a work permit. Like everybody involved, Commissario Brunetti wonders why anyone would kill an illegal immigrant. But once Brunetti begins to investigate this unfamiliar Venetian underworld, he discovers that matters of great value are at stake within the secretive society. Warned by Patta, his superior, to resist further involvement in the case, Brunetti only becomes more determined to unearth the truth behind this mysterious killing. Reluctant as he is to let this event be smugly relegated to the category of "not worth dealing with," how far will Brunetti be able to penetrate the murky subculture in this illegal community? <i>Blood from a Stone</i> is an exquisite and irresistible mystery offering an unexpected take on life in contemporary Venice.<br><br>"A <b>subtle and sophisticated</b> mystery"&#x2013;<i>New York Times</i><br><br>"<b>Stunning</b>... Leon combines an engrossing, complex plot with an indictment fo the corruption endemic in Italian society." &#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br>"<b>Richly atmospheric</b>, Leon introduces you to the Venice insiders know." &#x2013;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>"The evocative Venitian setting and the warmth and humanity of the Brunetti family add considerable pleasure to this nuanced, intelligent mystery; <b>another winner</b> from Venice-based Leon. Highly recommended" &#x2013;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</p><p>Guido Brunetti, the protagonist of Donna Leon's brilliant series about crime in high and low places in Venice, Italy, is back in a smart thriller about a murdered street vendor, one of the illegal immigrants who sell fake fashion accessories outside the tourist mecca's high-priced boutiques while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. Someone had a reason for wanting the nameless African man dead, and the search for the killers and the men who sent them to Brunetti's beloved and beautifully evoked city shortly before Christmas leads the thoughtful, multifaceted and uxorious Commissario to the unfamiliar Venetian milieu where the vu cumpra live. In the cramped, airless room where the Senegalese vendors manage to find shelter, Guido discovers a fortune in so-called "conflict diamonds" hidden among the murdered man's meager belongings. But finding the diamonds' provenance and the killers who were seeking them proves to be an exercise in bureaucratic misdirection. Warned off the case by his boss in the name of "national security," Guido nonetheless persists with his investigation, in the course of which he discovers what--and who--really matters to him. Leon depicts the city she also clearly loves with such skill the reader can almost hear the watter lapping at the edges of the canals and smell the espresso beans roasting in the crisp cold winter air. A tour de force from an author whose reputation for skillful plotting, extraordinary descriptive powers, and complex characters has earned her a loyal base of fans; if you haven't discovered her work before this, <i>Blood from a Stone</i> will only whet your appetite for her extensive backlist of titles featuring Brunetti and his colleagues. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the international best-selling Commissario Guido Brunetti series.

Reading a page each day from <i>Spiritual Diary</i> is a great way to begin each day and supercharge our thoughts and activities with spiritual power.</p><p>Born in India on January 5, 1893, Paramahansa Yogananda devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Sri Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.</p><h2>Language Arts, Grade 5 (Interactive Notebooks)</h2><p>In Interactive Notebooks: Language Arts for fifth grade, students will complete hands-on activities about text structures, making predictions, editing and revising writing, conjunctions, figurative language, and more.

This twenty-eight-year-old may have a checkered past littered with romantic mistakes, excessive drinking, and creative vandalism; she may be addicted to <i>Get Smart</i> reruns and prefer entering homes through windows rather than doors&#x2014;but the upshot is she&#x2019;s good at her job as a licensed private investigator with her family&#x2019;s firm, Spellman Investigations. Invading people&#x2019;s privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman.<br> <br>Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who&#x2019;s become addicted to &#x201c;recreational surveillance&#x201d;); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed &#x201c;Lost Weekends&#x201d;).

She&nbsp;lives and works in upstate New York.Ari Graynor narrates this debut novel, telling the story of 28-year-old Isabel Izzy Spellman, who is struggling to stay sane while working for her familys private detective agency. Its difficult to imagine a better fit than Graynor for recounting Izzys madcap adventures, romantic disasters, and attempts to locate her missing sister, whose unhealthy habit of recreational surveillance has gotten her in trouble more than once with the police. With normal behavior in her family including going through other peoples trash, snooping outside hotel rooms, trailing men in San Franciscos Tenderloin district, and doing background checks on all of her future ex-boyfriends, Izzys story is one funny adventure after another.

The work focuses on the nature and management of soil fertility, and notably explores composting. At a time when modern, chemical-based industrialized agriculture was just beginning to radically alter food production, it advocated natural processes rather than man-made inputs as the superior approach to farming. It was first published in England in 1940.&nbsp; Since this book first appeared in 1940, it has been regarded as one of the most important contributions to the solution of soil rehabilitation problems ever published. More importantly, it is regarded as the keystone of the organic movement.</p><p>Louis Bromfield called it "the best book I know on soil and the processes which take part in it." <em>Soil Science</em> called it "the most interesting and suggestive book on soil fertility which has appeared since <em>King's Farmers of Forty Centuries</em>." And <em>Mother Earth News</em> recently called it "the most basic of all introductions to organic farming by the founder of the modern movement."</p><p>The object of the book was to draw attention to the loss of soil fertility, brought about by the vast increase in crop and animal production, that has led to such disastrous consequences as a general unbalancing of farming practices, an increase in plant and animal diseases and the loss of soil by erosion. Howard contended that such losses can be repaired only by maintaining soil fertility by manufacturing humus from vegetable and animal wastes through the composting process. He stressed, too, a little-known nutritional factor, the mycorrhizal association, which is the living fungous bridge between humus in the soil and the sap of plants.</p></p><p></p><h2>Under The Radar Michigan: The Next 50 (Under The Radar Michigan: Travel Guides)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Under the Radar Michigan&#x201d; is an Emmy award winning PBS television series that features the cool people, places and things that make Michigan a great place to live, work and play.

In <i>Firestorm at Peshtigo</i>, Denise Gess and William Lutz vividly re-create the personal and political battles leading to this monumental natural disaster, and deliver it from the lost annals of American history.</p></p><p><p><b>Denise Gess</b>, author of two critically acclaimed novels, is the visiting assistant professor of fiction writing at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington.</p><p><b>William Lutz</b> is a professor of English at Rutgers University and the author of fifteen books, including the bestseller <i>Doublespeak</i>. They live in Philadelphia.</p>In American history books, October 8, 1871, marks the massive fire that consumed Chicago. But as Gess (Good Deeds) and Lutz (Doublespeak) document in this thorough historical narrative, it was also the night a fledgling Wisconsin mining town endured a worse fate a story often overlooked in the annals of fire. Peshtigo, with a population of nearly 2,000, was obliterated in less than an hour that night by a freakish convergence of rampant forest fires and tornado-force winds. Gess and Lutz draw on a wealth of local sources, including diaries, interviews with survivors and newspaper accounts, to enliven their story and forge a cast of main characters. While the authors go into far too much detail in describing the town's founding and its politics, they render a chilling, absorbing account of the hellish events of the night itself, perhaps due to Gess's background as a novelist: " `Faster than it takes to write these words' is the phrase every survivor used. They used it to describe the speed of a fireball hitting a house and setting it into instant flames; they used it to describe the speed with which one house was lifted from its foundation, then thrown through the air `a hundred feet' before it detonated midflight and sent strips of flaming wood flying like shrapnel.... They used it to describe the sight of a small boy, separated from his family, and how he knelt to the ground, crouching in prayer before fire lit his body."

Written in the second person, it's intense and immediately devourable. <em>Sous Chef</em> has all the drama, disaster, and triumph people have come to expect from reality restaurant TV, but far more intimate and nuanced. On every page, Gibney turns out phrases to savor: this is kitchen writing on par with Gabrielle Hamilton's <em>Blood, Bones &amp; Butter</em>. No one who&#x2019;s read Anthony Bourdain&#x2019;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em> will be surprised by the more licentious elements, but the real thrills are those transcendent moments when every player is absorbed by their role, moving together to assemble a fantastic meal. In Gibney&#x2019;s hands, the anonymous act of preparing and serving great food to ravenous multitudes feels authentically noble, verging on heroic. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em></p><b>Michael Gibney</b> began working in restaurants at the age of sixteen and assumed his first sous chef position at twenty-two.

He examines a group of new surgical residents at a major teaching hospital in the Pacific Northwest as they tackle the roller-coaster ride of long hours, fascinating procedures, mundane office tasks, and emotional ups and downs that comprise the life of a student of surgery.</p><p>Andrew Holtz, MPH, is a health journalist. A former CNN medical correspondent&#x2014;and co-anchor for the <b>Your Health</b> program&#x2014;he now works as a freelancer covering health and medicine. Holtz earned a Master of Public Health degree in the Oregon MPH program. He received his BA from Stanford University where he majored in broadcast communication and minored in physics. He is a board member and past president of the Association of Health Care Journalists.The overachievers on the hit TV show <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> stand on the shoulders of M.D.s from decades of medical dramas. But health journalist Holtz finds more than a kernel of truth in the ABC white-coat soaper and notes, [O]ur attitudes and beliefs about surgery and medicine shift and adapt unconsciously while we take in the fiction from Seattle Grace Hospital. What unfolds in the book is a Cliff's Notes for surgical residents: the grueling hours&#x2014;a max of 80 a week; the weird operating flukes&#x2014;a flame bizarrely ignites from the gas in a surgery patient's gut; the need to give good care even to bad people. The anecdotes, however, seem as likely to come from <i>Grey's</i> as from real life. On the struggle in treating ailing criminals, one resident confides, I don't feel like my care was compromised by being aware that he was a criminal, but it definitely made me think about it. There's little new in these tales from the sick ward, but Holtz gives them all a Hollywood glow. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Oliver. The author claimed that he was used as a channel by 'Phylos', an advanced being who had once lived in the fabled city of Atlantis. The advanced philosophy found in this book tells a remarkable, personal tale of achievement and temptation, of other planes of existence, reincarnation and the inexorable unfolding of Karma. Atlantean society is also described in detail, with its concept of the One Substance underlying all phenomena, and its advanced science and technology that include devices mirroring many of today's modern instruments. If the book is fiction, these accounts make Frederick Oliver's book a profound, almost inexplicable, achievement for one so young. If it is indeed a channeled message from a spiritually advanced being, <em>A Dweller on Two Planets</em>&nbsp;provides copious esoteric information indispensable to all students of the occult.</p></p><p>Frederick S.

A stunningly prescient essay on the rising influence of advertising, marketing, and publicity, <i>The Present Age</i> is essential reading for anyone who wishes to better understand the modern world. </p></p><p>The first book ever to explore the popular culture created by new media technologies (in this case, newspapers), <i>The Present Age</i> is shockingly relevant despite being written more than 100 years ago. Kierkegaard's prescience in predicting a public that consumes the lives of media stars speaks for itself: "The public ... this indolent mass ... is on the look-out for distraction and soon abandons itself to the idea that everything that anyone does is done in order to give it something to gossip about." <i>The Present Age</i> does a better job of describing the manipulation of mass opinion by the media than anything written since the rise of television, and contains Kierkegaard's cutting wit and nimble prose, to boot.<p>S�ren Kierkegaard (1813&#x2013;1855) lived in Copenhagen, Denmark. His books include <em>Works of Love</em> and <em>Spiritual Writings</em> (translated and edited by George Pattison).</p></p><h2>Writing Assessment and Instruction for Students with Learning Disabilities</h2><p><b>A hands-on guide for anyone who teaches writing to students with learning disabilities</b> <p>This valuable resource helps teachers who want to sharpen their skills in analyzing and teaching writing to students with learning disabilities.

Then we'll take a deep dive into how the wireless and mobile networks work under the hood--this radio thing, it's very different--and discuss its implications for how we design and architect our applications. Finally, we will dissect how the HTTP protocol works under the hood and investigate the many new and exciting networking capabilities in the browser:<br><ul><li>Upcoming HTTP 2.0 improvements</li><li>New XHR features and capabilities</li><li>Data streaming with Server-Sent Events</li><li>Bidirectional communication with WebSocket</li><li>Peer-to-peer video and audio communication with WebRTC</li><li>Peer-to-peer data exchange with DataChannel</li></ul>Understanding how the individual bits are delivered, and the properties of each transport and protocol in use are essential knowledge for delivering high-performance applications. After all, if our applications are blocked waiting on the network, then no amount of rendering, JavaScript, or any other form of optimization will help! Our goal is to eliminate this wait time by getting the best possible performance from the network.<br><br><i>High-Performance Browser Networking</i>&nbsp;will be of interest to anyone interested in optimizing the delivery and performance of her applications, and more generally, curious minds that are not satisfied with a simple checklist but want to know how the browser and the underlying protocols actually work under the hood.

A vivid exploration of nearly two centuries of Roman history, <i>Pax Romana</i> recounts real stories of aggressive conquerors, failed rebellions, and unlikely alliances.<b>Why this book? </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Peace is always a rare and precious thing and this makes the &#x201c;Roman Peace&#x201d; all the more remarkable, and I wanted to understand how it came about. I wanted also to understand what the Roman Empire meant to the people who lived in it. What was it like for the other peoples in the ancient world who found themselves living next to the Roman Empire, or were incorporated into it, whether by force or choice? It is simplistic to demonize empires&#x2014;just as it once was to celebrate them uncritically&#x2014;and there is a danger of turning conquered peoples into passive and virtuous victims of imperialist aggression. The truth is more complicated, and looking at Roman power from the viewpoint of Romans and outsiders provides many relevant insights to our own world.<br><br> <b>But wasn&#x2019;t "Pax Romana" the peace imposed by the victors, whose conceit was that they were bringing civilization to barbarians?</b><br><br> The Romans fought a lot of wars, and never granted other peoples equal status. Other kingdoms and states were either allies or real or potential enemies. Peace made Rome and its allies safe. Only once they were well on their way to establishing a large and permanent empire did the Romans begin to talk of a duty to bring peace, order, and the rule of law to a wider world. This was not achieved solely or even primarily by force. People wanted to be Roman. Peace became a reality, even if imperfect.<br> <b>Praise for <i>Caesar:</i></b><br><br> "This book makes and insightfully explains the leap from Caesar the soldier and general to Caesar the statesman and nation builder.

Gathering some of his most iconic images, many of which were taken in the far corners of the earth, this exquisite book brings a fresh perspective to his extensive catalog. Recognized as a pioneer of American color photography since the 1970s, Webb has consistently created photographs characterized by intense color and light. His work, with its richly layered and complex composition, touches on multiple genres, including street photography, photojournalism, and fine art, but as Webb claims, "to me it all is photography. You have to go out and explore the world with a camera." Webb's ability to distill gesture, color and contrasting cultural tensions into single, beguiling frames results in evocative images that convey a sense of enigma, irony and humor. Featuring key works alongside previously unpublished photographs, "The Suffering of Light" provides the most thorough examination to date of this modern master's prolific, 30-year career.<br>The photographs of Alex Webb (born 1952) have appeared in a wide range of publications, including "The New York Times Magazine," "Life," "Stern" and "National Geographic," and have been exhibited at the International Center of Photography, New York; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

Smith of Utah. When Henry David Thoreau wrote that in wildness is the preservation of the world, he might have been writing about Utah, with its five national parks, seven national monuments, thirteen wilderness areas. In Utah Wild and Beautiful, Scott T. Smith offers us brilliantly colored, clear images of the landscapes and landforms in the state where Brigham Young and his lieutenants declared at the mouth of Emigrant Canyon on July 24, 1847, This is the Place. In 158 photographs carefully selected from 26 years of work, Scott shows you the home of some of the world s most beautiful natural features: the grand sweep of Capitol Reef National Park, the rugged Mesa Arch, a rippled slot canyon in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, and blood-red paintbrush in Zion National Park. With a foreword by Tom Wharton of the Salt Lake Tribune, the book captures the grandeur of state in images large and small: sunlit mesas as well as a black-chinned hummingbird on a strand of barbed wire; immense slabs of cross-bedded Navaho Sandstone as well as delicate claret cup cactus blossoms; the rugged Factory Butte as well as a delicate elk pictograph. Wharton writes that in this book, Smith captures the vivid landscapes of Utah, large and small, the from the white desolation of the Bonneville Salt Flats to the sandstone arches to the sandhill cranes.</p><p>A former research meteorologist, Scott T. Smith has been a full-time freelance photographer since 1988. His images have appeared in periodicals including Audubon, National Geographic Traveler, Outside, and Sunset.

Modern businesses continue to place huge emphasis on technical training, yet a lot of what determines the success or failure of organisations has nothing to do with the sort of hard skills taught at business school; instead, it comes down to the degree of emotional intelligence circulating in the workplace. This is a book that introduces us to twenty core emotional skills that can help businesses to flourish. They range from giving honest feedback, to accepting that it&#x2019;s OK to fail, to addressing jealousies and insecurities within teams. We learn about how our childhoods continue to have an often unhelpful impact on how we deal with colleagues, and the best ways we might speak so that others will listen. The book is informed by the practical work that the Learning and Development division of The School of Life carries out, endeavouring to change the culture within organisations around the world through teaching teams the art of emotional intelligence.</p><p><p><strong>The School of Life</strong> is a global organization helping people lead more fulfilled lives. It is a resource for helping us understand ourselves, for improving our relationships, our careers, and our social lives&#x2015;as well as for helping us find calm and get more out of our leisure hours. They do this through films, workshops, books, and gifts&#x2015;and through a warm and supportive community. You can find <strong>The School of Life</strong> online, in stores and in welcoming spaces around the globe. </p><p><strong>The School of Life Press</strong> was established in 2016 to bring together over a decade of research and insights from The School of Life&#x2019;s content team. Led by founder and series editor <strong>Alain de Botton</strong>, this is a library to educate, entertain, console, and transform us.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong></p><p><strong>The challenges</strong></p> We have done so much to overcome the more obvious, external barriers to communication. We have ringed the earth with satellites and enlaced it with cables. At a surface level, we are always available. But ironically, the trickiest obstacles to communication continue to occur in what seem like the most favourable circumstances: when we&#x2019;re standing in a room close to another person who speaks, ostensibly, exactly our language. To be a good communicator at a psychological level, we need to be equipped with the very best kind of emotional education. We need an ability to understand what we ourselves think and feel; confidence that we will be able to make ourselves heard by others; the capacity to be patient and non-aggressive in relaying messages; the skill to evade the defence mechanisms or boredom of our listeners; an open-mindedness in hearing ideas that could sound foreign or threatening; and, finally, a culture that lends legitimacy to the idea of people talking frankly to one another about the most vital things. Despite our extraordinary prowess at the technical side of communication, humans have made very little progress towards improving the quality of psychological communication between ourselves. We still too often fall into sulks and furies; we don&#x2019;t say what is on our minds or fail to get our points across. Despite all the masts and satellites, there are still too many children not communicating honestly with their parents, couples not listening to each other and colleagues not finding the right words. There are still too many suicide notes and deathbeds on which the majority is left unsaid. So much of what we want to say remains locked up inside us, or travels between humans as unreliably as the pigeon post of two hundred years ago. <p><strong>The remarkable need to speak</strong></p> It sounds absurd when stated baldly, but we do not always understand that we need to speak to those whom we so wish would understand us. We long for our intentions to be known, for our moods to be honoured, for our states of mind to be read &#x2013; but we do not want to speak and we don&#x2019;t particularly see an urgent need to do so. We want to be guessed at, intuited, read by a kind of magic we don&#x2019;t realise we believe in. We want people to know what we have not bothered to tell them. In certain moods, we may even suspect that they know full well what we think and want, but are deliberately frustrating us in order to score points and humiliate us. The only explanations for them not having guessed already is rudeness, lack of love or extreme stupidity. We think like this not because we are evil: we are stubbornly mute because we were, for a short but profound length of time, infants. In other words, for a momentous stretch, we were in the odd position where we could not utter a word. Others had to guess what was on our minds. And most importantly, for a while, they were more or less correct. They listened to our crying, witnessed our angry faces, saw our outstretched arms... they had a shot at guessing and they got it right. They fetched some milk; they picked up our toy from the floor; they put us on their shoulder and walked us around the living room &#x2013; and we felt calm and satiated. They were not geniuses at interpersonal understanding: they guessed correctly because it was easy. The things we needed back then were so uncomplicated and so limited: food and drink, clean clothes, sleep, hygiene and reassurance. This ancestral memory of successful mind-reading has the paradoxical effect of making us more isolated and intemperate than we need to be in later life. We keep expecting that a process that unfolded successfully when we were young might continue to occur &#x2013; even though our needs have grown infinitely more sophisticated. We don&#x2019;t just need milk and a cuddle: we need people to understand how our diary is looking next week; what the hand we put around them in bed means; how the kitchen should be left; where the towels need to hang; how the document should get back to the NY office; who should have the remote control; and how we feel about their mother. And we want them to know all this not on the basis of careful and slow instructions and eloquent, patient and playful disquisitions, but immediately, just like that, on the basis that they are intelligent and that they care for us. If they don&#x2019;t understand, there might be cause to shout, to accuse them of laziness or a lack of affection or to fire them. We are terrible communicators because we refuse to accept the dignity, necessity and complexity of the act of communication. We wander the earth with the problems of sophisticated adults insisting on believing that we are as easy to understand as infants.</p><h2>The Psychology of Fashion (The Psychology of Everything)</h2><p><p><em>The Psychology of Fashion</em> offers an insightful introduction to the exciting and dynamic world of fashion in relation to human behaviour, from how clothing can affect our cognitive processes to the way retail environments manipulate consumer behaviour.

Despite its low-rent origins, the mag was an overnight success in the underground music scene, selling out every print run across the US and UK. Every musician who appeared on the cover of <em>Punk</em> became an icon of the era. But <em>Punk</em> not only championed music, it became a launching pad for writers, artists, cartoonists, and graphic designers.

I adjust my grip on the phone, hoping I misheard her tone. This doesn't sound like Chelsea. This voice is breathless. Frightened.</p> <p>"I'm here," I say. "What's up? You don't sound right."</p> <p>"I'm not." She takes a shuddery breath.</p> <p>My shirt's sticking to my back and cicadas are click-buzzing the end of another blistering day, but I go cold. Something's wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p> <p>"It's my dad, Emmie," she says. I can tell she's crying.</p> <p>I grab my chest. It's too tight. Burning. "What happened?"</p> <p>Her words all tumble out on top of one another, interrupted by shaky breaths. I try to pick out pieces that make sense. "He's hurt-bleeding-we're behind the ambulance and I can't-he's not-someone attacked him."</p> <p>I start climbing the porch steps, because she'll need me. I'm her best friend, so I should be there. I need to change clothes and go. "You're on the way to the hospital, right? They'll help him there."</p> <p>Another sharp breath. "I don't know if they can. He's so bad. So bad."</p> <p>My heart clenches. "Where are you?"</p> <p>"We're almost there. Joel's with me."</p> <p>"Okay, good. I'm coming," I say, crossing my porch and hauling my front door open. "Let me just call Mom. I'll borrow the car."</p> <p>Chelsea's still crying when I storm down the hallway toward my bedroom. "Emmie, I can't find Deacon..."</p> <p>"Your brother never answers his phone," I say, pushing open my door. "I'll run by the docks first and-"</p> <p>"No. No, he was there. He was at the house."</p> <p>Chelsea makes a strangled sound, and I notice the liquid-thick heat in my bedroom. The kind of heat that tells me the air conditioner is broken. Or my window is open.</p> <p>My gaze drags to my fluttering white curtains, to the dark smudge on the windowsill.</p> <p>Chelsea's voice goes low and raspy. "He ran, Emmie. God, he was there with Dad. He was in the house, but he ran."</p> <p>I swivel with an invisible fist lodged in my throat. My bathroom door is open, a red-black smudge beneath the knob.</p> <p>My mouth goes dry, my pulse thumping slower than it should. Then I see the blood on the floor by my sink, and my heart tumbles end over end.</p> <p>"We're here. I'll call soon," Chelsea says and hangs up.</p> <p>I see him, his back to my tub and his dark head bowed on one bent knee. Oh God.</p> <p>He's covered in blood. It's on his legs, his hands. Dripping onto my white tile floor. He looks up, and my heart goes strangely steady.</p> <p>I take a breath that tastes like purpose.</p> <p>"Deacon?"</p></p><h2>Big Block Quilts: 10 Projects with Big Imapct</h2><p>This is the time to discover quilts with big blocks.

Against a snowy, wooded background, the child sets out in her red cloak to bring Mother's chicken soup and raisin muffins to ailing Grandmother. The story proceeds in the expected way. The woodcutter kills the wolf "with one stroke of his ax" and cuts open the beast's stomach, releasing "the kindly old woman." With lively detail (but no blood and guts) and lots of pattern and colors, Pinkney's watercolors show the predator in nightcap and glasses under Grandmother's patchwork quilt&#x2013;&#x2013;and then, in a double-page spread, the menace as it appears to the girl: "Oh Grandmother, what great teeth you have!" The pictures reflect the danger and the coziness, and they are just right for their preschool audience.

In the course of all these lives, I had a front-row seat at the birth of television; wrote, produced, created, or developed more than a hundred shows; had nine on the air at the same time; founded the 300,000-member liberal advocacy group People For the American Way; was labeled the &#x201c;no. 1 enemy of the American family&#x201d; by Jerry Falwell; made it onto Richard Nixon&#x2019;s &#x201c;Enemies List&#x201d;; was presented with the National Medal of Arts by President Clinton; purchased an original copy of the Declaration of Independence and toured it for ten years in all fifty states; blew a fortune in a series of bad investments in failing businesses; and reached a point where I was informed we might even have to sell our home. Having heard that we&#x2019;d fallen into such dire straits, my son-in-law phoned me and asked how I was feeling. My answer was, &#x201c;Terrible, of course,&#x201d; but then I added, &#x201c;But I must be crazy, because despite all that&#x2019;s happened, I keep hearing this inner voice saying, &#x2018;Even&nbsp;</i>this<i>&nbsp;I get to experience.&#x2019;&#x201d;</i><br><br>Norman Lear&#x2019;s work is legendary. The renowned creator of such iconic television programs as&nbsp;<i>All in the Family</i>;<i> Maude</i>;<i> Good Times</i>;<i> The Jeffersons</i>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman</i>, Lear remade our television culture from the ground up. At their peak, his programs were viewed by 120 million people a week, with stories that dealt with the most serious issues of the day&#x2014;racism, poverty, abortion&#x2014;yet still left audiences howling with laughter. In <i>Even </i>This<i> I Get to Experience</i>, Lear opens up with all the candor, humor, and wisdom to be expected from one of America&#x2019;s greatest living storytellers.<br><br>But TV and politics are only a fraction of the tale. Lear&#x2019;s early years were grounded in the harshness of the Great Depression and further complicated by his parents&#x2019; vivid personalities. The imprisonment of Lear&#x2019;s father, a believer in the get-rich-quick scheme, colored his son&#x2019;s childhood. During this absence, Lear&#x2019;s mother left her son to live with relatives. Lear&#x2019;s comic gifts were put to good use during this hard time, as they would be decades later during World War II, when Lear produced and staged a variety show for his fellow airmen in addition to flying fifty bombing missions.<br><br>After the war, Lear tried his hand at publicity in New York before setting out for Los Angeles in 1949. A lucky break had a powerful agent in the audience the night Danny Thomas performed a nightclub routine written by Lear, and within days his career in television began. Before long, his work with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis (and later Martha Raye and George Gobel) made him the highest-paid comedy writer in the country, and he was spending his summers with the likes of Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks. Movies followed, and soon he was making films starring Frank Sinatra, Dick Van Dyke, and Jason Robards. Then came the &#x2019;70s and Lear&#x2019;s unprecedented string of TV hits.<br><br>Married three times and the father of six children ranging in age from nineteen to sixty-eight, Lear&#x2019;s penetrating look at family life, parenthood, and marriage is a volume in itself. A memoir as touching, funny, and remarkable as any of Lear&#x2019;s countless artistic creations, <i>Even </i>This<i> I Get to Experience</i> is nothing less than a profound gift, endlessly readable and characteristically unforgettable.</p><p><b>Norman Lear</b> is the television producer of such groundbreaking sitcoms as <i>All in the Family</i>, <i>Sanford and Son</i>, <i>One Day at a Time</i>, <i>The Jeffersons</i>, <i>Good Times</i>, and <i>Maude</i>. He has received four Emmy awards, a Peabody, and the National Medal of Arts. As an activist, he founded People For the American Way. He lives in Los Angeles. Most recently, Mr. Lear is the subject of the PBS American Masters episode, Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You, premiering 10/25/16.<p>WHEN I WAS A BOY I thought that if I could turn a screw in my father&#x2019;s head just a sixteenth of an inch one way or the other, it might help him to tell the difference between right and wrong. I couldn&#x2019;t, of course, and ultimately he&#x2014;and I&#x2014;had to pay a serious price for his confusion.</p><p>In late June of 1931, just out of third grade and a month away from turning nine, I was eagerly looking forward to my first experience at summer camp.

They offer a picture of America that we hold dear, representing a world of hope and humanity.<br> <br>Fred Bauer writes about Rockwell's message of optimism and the artist's faith in America and its people in a forthright and sympathetic text complemented by numerous Rockwell favorites in all their warmth and color. Bauer visits Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and Arlington, Vermont, talking to the people who lived with Rockwell and posed for his anecdotal pictures, the people about whom the artist said, "If you are interested in the characters you draw and understand them and love them, why, the people who see your pictures are bound to feel the same way." This lovely book enables us to partake once again of that unique love and understanding that Norman Rockwell still communicates to America.<br></p><p>There is no mistaking a Norman Rockwell painting. His knack for capturing honest folk in the nostalgic light of a simpler America made him one of the most beloved artists of his time, creating instant recognition for his popular illustrations. Some might scoff at the now long-faded idealism that informed his canvases, but for many Americans Rockwell's work has come to symbolize the heart and soul of a more sympathetic society, one free from the condescending sneer of cynicism. Fred Bauer, author of this well-researched and extensive collection is definitely one of the deceased painter's most informed and ardent champions. Included here are the pieces he believes represent the, "more inspirational illustrations, the ones that lifted spirits and filled doubting hearts with hope and faith." Accordingly, he groups them in chapters addressing specific types of faith, such as the kind found in loved ones, traditions, country, etc., and Bauer's text offers much more than simple description. He takes us on a journey to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, Rockwell's immortalized home town, where he meets with the painter's widow, searches out former models, and chats up the local folks who knew Rockwell not as a maker of lasting icons, but as a friend and neighbor. With careful attention and thoughtful insight he has created a kind of written portrait that offers a level of understanding and appreciation for the artist that can only add to the enjoyment shared by Rockwell's countless admirers. <i>--George Laney</i><b>Fred Bauer</b> has written more than a dozen books, including the <i>How Many Hills to Hillsboro?</i>, <i>Everett Dirksen: The Man and His Words</i>, and <i>Then Sings My Soul</i> (with George Beverly Shea). Born in Ohio, he has worked widely in communications and with radio, newspapers, and magazines.<br></p><h2>The Conch Bearer (Brotherhood of the Conch)</h2><p>In a dingy shack in the less-than-desirable Indian neighborhood he calls home, twelve-year-old Anand is entrusted with a conch shell that possesses mystical powers. His task is to return the shell to its rightful home many hundreds of miles away. Accompanying him are Nisha, a headstrong but resourceful child of the streets, and a mysterious man of indeterminate age and surprising resources named Abadhyatta. His quest will take him farther from home than he&#39;s ever been and will teach him more than he ever imagined -- and it will force him to make a poignant decision that will change him forever.</p><p>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is the author of sixteen books, including <i>Oleander Girl</i>, <i>The Mistress of Spices</i>, <i>Sister of My Heart</i>, <i>Palace of Illusions</i>, <i>One Amazing Thing</i>, and <i>Before We Visit the Goddess.</i> Her work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>,<i> The Atlantic Monthly</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>, and has won, among other prizes, an American Book Award. Born in India, she currently lives in Texas and is the McDavid professor of Creative Writing at the University of Houston.When we first meet 12-year-old Anand, he is carrying an armload of dishes through a crowded tea stall of Kolkata, India. His sister is sick, and his mother depends on the little he brings home. But he's a gentle boy, not hardened by this environment, kind to others, and, most of all, he believes in the magic of dreams. That is why those who keep the conch come to him for help. Somehow whorled into this conch are great powers, and it must be returned. Reader Alan Cumming's voice echoes with this mysterious energy and the noisy streets of India. It has that delicate hint of the Indian English dialect that is at once so precise and so distant, in a story that suggests both the magic of Harry Potter and the grit of Dickens's OLIVER TWIST. Both story and reader are pungent with the spiced tea and the spiked lightning of Anand's fantasy, if it is fantasy.

Founded in 1926, McKinsey can lay claim to the following partial list of accomplishments: its consultants have ushered in waves of structural, financial, and technological change to the nation&#x2019;s best organizations; they remapped the power structure within the White House; they even revo�lutionized business schools. In <i>The New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Firm</i>, star financial journalist Duff McDonald shows just how, in becoming an indispensable part of decision making at the highest levels, McKinsey has done nothing less than set the course of American capitalism. <br> <br>But he also answers the question that&#x2019;s on the mind of anyone who has ever heard the word McKinsey: Are they worth it? After all, just as McKinsey can be shown to have helped invent most of the tools of modern management, the company was also involved with a number of striking failures. Its consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground, and they were K-Mart&#x2019;s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron.<br> <br>McDonald is one of the few journalists to have not only parsed the record but also penetrated the culture of McKinsey itself. His access puts him in a unique position to demonstrate when it is worth hiring these gurus&#x2014;and when they&#x2019;re full of smoke.</p><p>A contributing editor at <i>The New York Observer</i>, Duff McDonald has also written for <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>New York</i> magazine, <i>Fortune</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>, among other publications.The Firm <br> INTRODUCTION:<p></p> THE MCKINSEY MYSTIQUE<p></p> <br> <br>Two minutes out of business school, Jamie Dimon decided to become a consultant. The experience left him unimpressed, and he has looked down on it since. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s substitute management,&#x201d; he told me when I was deep into writing his biography. &#x201c;A Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It&#x2019;s political, so if you make a decision, you can say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not my fault, it&#x2019;s their fault.&#x2019;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think consultants can become a disease for corporations.&#x201d; Dimon, who went on to become the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase and was hailed as an Olympian financier for steering the bank above Wall Street&#x2019;s 2008 humbling&#x2014;only to be somewhat humbled himself four years later when its own trading caused more than $5 billion in losses&#x2014;made one exception to his consultant rule. Most consulting engagements weren&#x2019;t worth the price paid, he said, but McKinsey&#x2014;well, it was the real thing.<br> <br>Four years later, the Republican candidate for president, once a consultant himself, was asked how he would reduce the size of government. &#x201c;So I would have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least some structure that McKinsey would guide me to put in place,&#x201d; Mitt Romney told the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. When his audience seemed surprised, he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not kidding. I probably would bring in McKinsey.&#x201d;<br> <br>After almost a century in business, McKinsey can lay claim to the following incomplete list of accomplishments: Once before, well before Romney was running for the presidency, it remapped the power structure within the White House; it guided postwar Europe through a massive corporate reorganization; it helped invent the bar code; it revolutionized business schools; it even created the idea of budgeting as a management tool.<br> <br>Above all, McKinsey consultants have helped companies and governments create and maintain many of the corporate behaviors that have shaped the world in which we live. And in becoming an indispensable part of decision making at the highest levels, they have not only emerged as one of the great business success stories of our time but also helped invent what we think of as American capitalism and spread it to every corner of the world. The abstract, white-collar nature of modern business&#x2014;the fact that the greatest value in our economy is now created by people sitting in air-conditioned skyscrapers and corporate parks who manipulate information&#x2014;is a reality that McKinsey was instrumental in establishing, championing, and profiting from. The best evidence for McKinsey&#x2019;s expertise is the firm itself. It has followed its own advice into an enviable position of power and prestige.<br> <br>At the same time, however, the company can also be saddled with a list of striking failures, missteps that would have doomed lesser firms. McKinsey consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground. They were Kmart&#x2019;s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They pushed Swissair in a direction that led to its collapse. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron and collected massive fees right up until the moment of its spectacular explosion. And these are just the clients unlucky enough to have had their woes splashed across headlines. Many more have paid handsomely for guidance that shortchanged shareholders, led to unnecessary layoffs, and even prompted bankruptcies. And yet the consultants are rarely blamed for their bad advice&#x2014;at least not publicly so.<br> <br>Remarkably, that pervasive influence has come even though McKinsey contains more contradictions than the Bible. The firm is well known, but there is almost nothing known about it. Precious few McKinsey employees have ever become acclaimed in the outside world. The employees are trusted and distrusted&#x2014;and loved and despised&#x2014;in equal measure. They are a collection of huge egos that are yet content to stay behind the scenes. They are confident but also paranoid. And they are helpful yet manipulative with their clientele&#x2014;and even their own people.<br> <br>What do they actually do? They are managerial experts, cost cutters, scapegoats, and catalysts for corporate change. They are the businessman&#x2019;s businessmen. They are the corporate Mandarin elite, a private corps, far from prying eyes, doing behind-the-scenes work for the most powerful people in the world. How do they do it? Well, their methods have been compared (by others and by themselves) to the Jesuits, the U.S. Marines, and the Catholic Church. They feel so strongly about themselves that they have insisted on a proper noun where one need not exist. To an outsider, they are a consulting firm. To themselves, simply, The Firm.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>But the McKinsey story is even more than all of that. It&#x2019;s also about the rise and reach of American business in the twentieth century&#x2014;and its remarkable adaptability to changing times. American capitalism may be under stress now, but modern American management technique&#x2014;which McKinsey has played a part in both creating and disseminating&#x2014;has distinguished itself as much by its innovative ability as by its sheer might. Today McKinsey is a global success story. But first it was a distinctly American one.<br> <br>One of the secrets of McKinsey is its very similarity to America&#x2014;it has a solid foundation with an adaptive overlay, all topped off with a bit of old-fashioned luck. Make no mistake: McKinsey is not an enduring institution by accident. It has been built with much purpose. Still, could it be an accident of history, founded in the right place at the right time? Yes, but only in the same way that Google, LEGO, and Toyota are accidents. Other companies stumble into extinction.<br> <br>McKinsey started in typically American fashion: with self-invention. Although it was technically founded in 1926 by a University of Chicago accounting professor named James O. McKinsey, the mythical leader of the firm is a successor, Marvin Bower, a man whose abiding goal was to invent a new profession committed to preparing clients for the challenges and uncertainties of the onrushing future. Plenty of other firms had the same idea at the same time, some even earlier, but none could match Bower&#x2019;s discipline and focus. He distinguished McKinsey not just for what it did but for how it went about it, starting with the physical appearance of its employees and moving right on through hiring, training, and the culling of their ranks through a merciless system known as &#x201c;up-or-out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Consultants of one kind or another have existed for centuries. Han Fei Tzu, founder of the so-called legalist school of ancient Chinese philosophy and adviser to the emperor, has been called the first consultant.1 But McKinsey can nevertheless claim a remarkable number of firsts: It was the first consulting firm to realistically apply scientific approaches to management, solving business problems with a method of hypothesis, data, and proof. It was the first to gamble on youth over experience, and the first to take on the challenge of becoming truly global.<br> <br>McKinsey was a major player in the efficiency boom of the 1920s, the postwar gigantism of the 1940s, the rationalization of government and rise of marketing in the 1950s, the age of corporate influence in the 1960s, the restructuring of America and rise of strategy in the 1970s, the massive growth in information technology in the 1980s, the globalization of the 1990s, and the boom-bust-and-cleanup of the 2000s and beyond. So pervasive is the firm&#x2019;s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>So what is the net effect of McKinsey consultants in the world? What has been gained and lost as this relatively small group of like-minded people has consolidated power and spread the gospel of American capitalism? It&#x2019;s best to take that question from a few different perspectives.<br> <br>McKinsey&#x2019;s clients, specifically those in the executive suite and the boardroom, have gotten an extremely intelligent if high-priced sounding board, a beacon in the night of managerial uncertainty. McKinsey offers a kind of industrial espionage couched in the language of &#x201c;best practices.&#x201d; Want to know what the competition is up to? Hire McKinsey. After all, it&#x2019;s working with everyone else as well. The flip side of that argument is that your competitors find out about you too. But most clients have found the tradeoff rewarding.<br> <br>When IBM wanted to expand into Europe in the 1950s, whom did it call for some hand-holding? McKinsey. So too did scores of other companies, from Heinz to Hoover. And then when Europe started recovering its own confidence? Why, McKinsey was there to tell the likes of Volkswagen and Dunlop Rubber that they could surely bounce back from near devastation with the consultants&#x2019; help. With McKinsey&#x2019;s army of hardworking and youthful overachievers&#x2014;what one reporter called &#x201c;a SWAT team of business philosopher-kings&#x201d;2&#x2014;clients have surely gotten more effort per dollar spent than you might find anywhere else in the corporate milieu.<br> <br>They have a remarkable ability to be in the right place at the right time&#x2014;so many times, in fact, that you have to wonder whether they really can see the future. But the truth is subtler than that. They have created one of the most flexible business models in the history of Western capitalism: They sell what their clients are buying, and where the clients are buying it.<br> <br>So powerful is the McKinsey name that merely hiring the firm can bring the desired effect&#x2014;as in 2009, when publishing giant Cond� Nast brought in McKinsey to demonstrate its seriousness about reducing expenses by 30 percent. The rank and file got the message. The act of hiring McKinsey can be as symbolic as it is practical.<br> <br>Of course, criticisms of McKinsey&#x2019;s contributions to client welfare are not hard to find. For one, once McKinsey is inside a client, its consultants are adept at artfully creating a feedback loop through their work that purports to ease executive anxiety but actually creates more of it, offering and then obscuring what one author has referred to as &#x201c;an illusion of a sure path to the future.&#x201d;3 Executives can get so accustomed to McKinsey&#x2019;s presence that they can&#x2019;t function without it, leading to situations like the one at AT&amp;T in the early 1990s, when the company paid the firm $96 million over five years for ongoing work.<br> <br>In situations like this, there is a potential anticlient bias to the consultants&#x2019; business, where the long-term result is dependence on, not independence from, the consultants. In other words, once they get the wedge end of a relationship into a company in the form of one engagement, they usually manage to hammer in the rest&#x2014;becoming the so-called Men Who Came to Dinner. (To wit: They never leave.) McKinsey isn&#x2019;t actually embarrassed by this notion&#x2014;the firm calls it the &#x201c;transformational relationship,&#x201d; arguing that true change comes only from long-term relationships. But over the years, many McKinsey clients have paid for exorbitant, lengthy engagements with little to show for it.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>What the McKinsey consultant himself has gained is a far simpler question to answer. He has gained money, power, and prestige, as well as the pretense of an intellectually minded pursuit within the corporate sphere. He is not a banker, accountant, or lawyer. He is a thinker. He has had the chance to whisper into the ears of power, to exercise influence while being insulated from responsibility. McKinsey was Enron CEO Jeff Skilling&#x2019;s most favored outside adviser during the Houston natural gas company&#x2019;s rise and fall. Skilling went to jail for his transgressions; McKinsey emerged from the scandal largely unscathed.<br> <br>Perhaps best of all, a job at McKinsey is a ticket to almost anywhere in the world. The firm is the best finishing school in business, a launching pad, and a matchless r�sum� line. A job at McKinsey, regardless of duration, can serve as an enviable listening post for plum corporate roles, particularly at McKinsey&#x2019;s own clients. The firm has an astonishingly successful network of alumni, occupying corner offices and boardrooms all over the world. Lou Gerstner, the man famous for turning IBM around, worked at McKinsey before decamping for one of his clients, American Express. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman spent a decade at McKinsey before jumping ship to his client, Merrill Lynch. It literally happens about once a week.<br> <br>Of course, not everyone goes on to a distinguished career. Enron&#x2019;s Skilling came from McKinsey. Two figures convicted in the greatest insider-trading scandal in history&#x2014;the 2009&#x2013;12 investigation of convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam&#x2014;are ex&#x2013;McKinsey: former director Anil Kumar as well as former managing director Rajat Gupta.<br> <br>You rarely see an old McKinsey consultant&#x2014;like its symbiotic other, the Harvard Business School, the institution favors youth over experience. McKinsey is like Harvard in other ways. To the Harvard grad, there is Harvard and there is nowhere else. Likewise McKinsey. Indeed, McKinsey alumni almost all wear their sense of specialness for the rest of their lives. This is why the Rajaratnam scandal has shaken the firm to its roots. Even though Anil Kumar sold client secrets and Rajat Gupta trashed the firm&#x2019;s long-cherished value system in a public and mortifying way, neither event really affected the firm&#x2019;s business. The damage to its self-image has been much more severe.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Finally, what of society? There is little doubt that McKinsey has made the corporate world more efficient, more rational, more objective, and more fact based. But to what extent have its contributions gone beyond the bottom line?<br> <br>McKinsey would have the world believe that its consultants are missionaries of the best in business thinking; that by pushing companies fearlessly into the future they are not just boosting profits but aiding the cause of human progress itself. There is more than some merit to this point of view. And if the smartest, most successful companies in the world continue to hire them, that in and of itself is evidence of the value they create.<br> <br>But as with many of the world&#x2019;s big firms, it is also hard to overlook the mounting number of instances in which McKinsey advisers have behaved no better than mercenaries, collecting huge fees for work of dubious worth. At their most craven, they can be recruited to provide a high-gloss imprimatur of objectivity that is in reality mere cover for executives. They are, without question, the go-to consultants for managers seeking justification for savage cost cutting as well as a convenient scapegoat on whom to blame it. While this is surely impossible to measure, there is a distinct possibility that McKinsey may be the single greatest legitimizer of mass layoffs than anyone, anywhere, at any time in modern history.<br> <br>In a sense, McKinsey is the Goldman Sachs of the consulting world. Both occupy the top rung of their respective professions, but both have come to symbolize something else as well&#x2014;a nagging question of whether all the brainpower and energy devoted to them have tr...</p><h2>Siddur: Transliterated Linear, Weekday</h2><p><p>Can't read Hebrew yet?

Clark Elementary School Library, LA</p><h2>Man &amp; Woman: A Divine Invention</h2><p>In follow-up to her acclaimed&nbsp;Privilege of Being a Woman;, Dr. von Hildebrand expands the discussion to explore how the fullness of human nature is found in the perfect union between man and woman. God chose to create man doubly complex. He made man of both soul and body a spiritual reality and a material reality. To crown this complexity, He created them male and female. Dr. von Hildebrand elucidates the tragic separation that happened with original sin and the consequences of this brokenness in the world today: the distortion of the male and female genius, supernatural blindness, and the triumph of secularism. She explores how this brokenness can be healed by following God s Divine plan for man and woman. We see this first and foremost in our Blessed Mother, exemplar of the path to holiness. This is also seen in the characteristics of saintly male / female relationships between husbands and wives, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, brothers and sisters, and holy friendships. It is only by coming to more fully understand the Divine plan for man and woman, and submitting ourselves to His plan, that true complementarity harmony of body and soul, male and female can be accomplished.</p><p>It is scarcely an overstatement to say that if this book were read, <i>and heeded</i>; by this epoch, the Gadarene Slide on which modern culture finds itself would be halted. That, of course, is a fond dream. The point, however, is that in this slender volume we find the authentic vision of what womanhood is. Dr. von Hildebrand takes us to the very substance of the ineffable mystery of gender. Like every mystery that pours into the Creation from the mind of God, it is solemn, noble, majestic, and blissful. How squalid, brutal, and ruinous appear the currently sovereign theories of femininity next to the protohistoric nay, eternal reality. And what a high pleasure the reading of the case is: we are guided along by a massively civilized tutor whose knowledge of philosophy, literature, music, history, Scripture, theology, and liturgy illumines the whole thing. --Thomas Howard<br><br>In the fifty years I have followed the teachings and writings of Alice Von Hildebrand, I can say that <i>Man and Woman: A Divine Invention</i>; is the greatest. Not only is it brilliant, masterful, beautiful, and deep, but it is also full of charming wit, linked to contemporary ideas and wonderful quotations from past and present writers. You will also find in <i>Man and Woman: A Divine Invention</i>; fresh illuminating ideas about motherhood, virginity, and the exclusion of women from the priesthood. Every woman should read Alice Von Hildebrand's book, and also give it to family members and friends. --Ronda Chervin, Holy Apostles College and Seminary of Connecticut<br><br>This book is a profound meditation on the superiority of being over bustling, of love over the impress of one's will, and of receptivity to God over what we take to be our creative ingenuity. As such it poses challenges to those creatures we call men and women, but in different ways. Dr. Von Hildebrand reminds men that, apart from the genius for the personal and the concrete that women possess, they become the architects of heresy and inhumanity. She reminds women, meanwhile, of their at once humble and high calling to motherhood, physical or spiritual. Every page presents us the distilled wisdom of Dr. Von Hildebrand's habit of thinking with the Church, and learning from the lives of her most glorious and humblest saints, especially Our Lady. It is a work steeped in the reverence she enjoins upon us all. --Anthony Esolen, Providence College, Rhode Island</p><h2>The Night Before Christmas: A Bedtime Shadow Book (Activity Books) (Shadow Book Series)</h2><p>Readers can use a flashlight to see the pictures cast shadows on the wall while they read the classic Christmas poem.</p><p>Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

As a boy he helped his father clear land and even built a boat that he floated to New Orleans.

She and her husband live in Mexico and often collaborate on their books.Grade 1-3-- These books are a step easier than Adler's "First Biographies" (Holiday). Facts and personality are expertly mixed in the small blocks of text; Adler does a good job of covering character traits, family members, and large events without overburdening readers with too many facts. Calm, uncluttered color paintings add visual interest, extend the text (sometimes rather far: readers will have to find out elsewhere why the Boston Tea Party was "attended" by native Americans), and ennoble their presidential subjects--Lincoln, with an extra homely face and dark clothing, always stands out in a group, and Washington is last seen on a tall horse, atop a bluff, waving to a passing eagle. Some simplification is inevitable--Lincoln's election is the only mentioned cause of the Civil War and there's not a black face to be seen in . . . Washington, for instance--but by and large, these are inviting gateways, both to the array of longer books on these two presidents, such as Kathie Billingslea Smith's (both Messner, 1987), and to U.S. history in general. --John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Construction Planning, Equipment, and Methods, Ninth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Fully updated coverage of construction planning techniques and equipment technology</b></p><p><i>Construction Planning, Equipment and Methods, Ninth Edition</i>, follows in the footsteps of previous editions by laying out the fundamentals of machine utilization and production estimating in a logical, simple, and concise format.

It&#x2019;s your fault!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I mean. It&#x2019;s your fault we&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not. Prove it to me that it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to prove anything to you. It just is.&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced behind me, as if looking beyond them, and saw that they were young, casually dressed, and apparently (was it tennis rackets, golf gear?) were going on holiday together.<br><br>The Ping-Pong recriminations continued. &#x201c;Your fault.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, yours.&#x201d;<br><br>I had a momentary impulse to turn around and say, &#x201c;Listen to me! It does not matter one bit whose fault it is. Either you&#x2019;ll be in time for your flight or you won&#x2019;t. And if you miss this flight, there will be others. What&#x2019;s more, you don&#x2019;t know that this flight is the best one to be on. Perhaps this one will have engine trouble and the next one will arrive safely. Relax! You are ruining the beginning of your holiday with a useless skirmish.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, I didn&#x2019;t say anything. I think I could have gotten away with it if I had done it sweetly enough, but I imagined them telling someone later, &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what this wacky little old woman in the airport . . .&#x201d; Anyway, eavesdropping and intruding are both impolite, even if unintended and well meaning.<br><br>I took off my jacket and shoes and pushed them through the X-ray machine along with my carry-on bag with my computer out for inspection. Retrieving my possessions on the other side, balancing on one foot and then the other to hurriedly put on my shoes, I noticed the couple just in front of me, also just emerged through the sensor gate, taking a moment to kiss each other, give each other a hug. I was amused by the thought that they were congratulating each other for having made it through the security hurdle unscathed. It was the briefest of exchanges of affection, but it was there. Right in the middle of getting re-dressed. Then I thought, &#x201c;I should call the attention of the arguing folks behind me to the kissing folks in front of me. &#x2018;Look,&#x2019; I could tell them, &#x2018;here is another possibility. In fact, there are only two possibilities in any moment. You can kiss or you can fight. Kissing is better.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Of course, I said nothing and went on to my flight. I also knew then, as I know now as I write, that in situations where I feel stressed, I might behave like the couple behind me. Not even &#x201c;long ago, when I wasn&#x2019;t wise,&#x201d; but right now, when I presumably understand that struggling with anything to make it be other than what it is creates suffering. If my mind becomes confused, broadsided by a challenge that upsets it, even a &#x201c;minor&#x201d; one such as &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss my plane,&#x201d; I forget, at least for a while, what I know.<br><br>Becoming wise means, for me, forgetting less often&#x2014;and remembering sooner when I&#x2019;ve forgotten&#x2014;the three things that are fundamentally true. The Buddha called these the Three Characteristics of Experience.<br><br>Everything is always changing.<br><br>There is a cause-and-effect lawfulness that governs all unfolding experience.<br><br>What I do matters, but I am not in charge. Suffering results from struggling with what is beyond my control.<br><br>The line from the Dhammapada, a compilation of say- ings attributed to the Buddha, that sums this up for me, that seems the one-sentence best expression of wisdom, is: &#x201c;Anyone who understands impermanence, ceases to be contentious.&#x201d;<br><br>Does that make sense to you on as many levels as it does to me? I understand it, primarily, as meaning &#x201c;I have only a certain span of life allotted to me, so I don&#x2019;t want to waste a single moment of it fighting.&#x201d; Other times, if I catch myself on the brink of contention, the instruction reminds me, &#x201c;Whatever is happening will change, and what I add to this situation is part of the change. Agonizing makes it worse.&#x201d; And sometimes, if I remember that whatever is happening will cause results that I really cannot anticipate (although I often do and worry needlessly), I say to myself, &#x201c;I have no idea whether this changed circumstance, which I resent, is actually a good or a bad thing in the long run. I can wait to see.&#x201d;<br><br>Many people have told me, when I&#x2019;ve asked for examples of wise people in their lives, &#x201c;My granddad [or grandmother or elderly neighbor of my childhood or eighth-grade math teacher] always said, &#x2018;You do the best you can, and then you live with what happens. What else can you do?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>I think in these descriptions of wisdom, the important word is always. Those wise people always said . . . They did not forget. I forget. I know&#x2014;I think we all do from innumerable events in our experience&#x2014;that the moment in which the mind acknowledges &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t what I wanted, but it&#x2019;s what I got&#x201d; is the point at which suffering disappears. Sadness might remain present, but the mind, having given up the fight for another reality, is free to console, free to support the mind&#x2019;s acceptance of the situation, free to allow space for new possibilities to come into view.<br><br>My own experience is that I keep learning this lesson, over and over again. My wisdom is definitely not unshakable. Here is an example, from all too recent an experience. I became distracted, and . . . Well, here is the story, which speaks for itself.<br><br>I went to the antique store in the town in France where I live part of each year to protest the unexpected 400-euro charge that had arrived along with the mattress and innerspring for the bed I&#x2019;d bought there. I had telephoned in advance. Madame Blaise, the antiquaire, had explained that, unfortunately, the unique size of beds made in the 1840s, especially the rounded corners, had required that a special-order mattress and springs be constructed. I was going in person to continue the discussion, but I was unhappy about going. I am, by nature, conflict-avoidant. I was urged on and accompanied by my husband, Seymour, who was angry and who does not speak French. I was caught between trying to please him and trying not to displease Madame Blaise.<br><br>&#x201c;Remind her,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that she told us what the price of the mattress would be, that it was included with the bed, and that we already paid for it. If there is anything extra, she should pay. She is the expert. It is her responsibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Madame is an eighty-five-year-old small-town antiquaire,&#x201d; I countered. &#x201c;She is not Macy&#x2019;s. You can&#x2019;t undo these things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair, though,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;You should insist that she make amends. If you won&#x2019;t do it, I will. I&#x2019;ll pantomime how unhappy I am. Even if she won&#x2019;t give us any money back, she could at least offer us something like those bedside tables you were looking at when we bought the bed.&#x201d;<br><br>I spoke to Madame Blaise in my most elegant and polite French, explaining our shock, our dismay, and our distress about having trusted her judgment and now needing to pay the mattress company 400 euros. I looked pointedly at some of the furniture around us and suggested that she might consider making us a gift of bedside tables as a form of reparation. I ended by saying that we had enjoyed our previous meetings with her and were sad that we were now left with bad feelings, mauvaises �motions.</p><h2>Out of Breath (Breathing)</h2><p><p><b><i>Out of Breath</i> is the first book in the million-copy bestselling Breathing Series.</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;My insides still burned.

Coyne, PhD, Special Education Program, University of Connecticut<br><br> &#x201c;This is the book all elementary schools need to implement truly responsive and effective reading intervention. All the essential content that needs to be taught is carefully laid out in each chapter. The embedded case studies with instructional plans are very useful. The chapter on multicomponent intervention is unique and valuable--its focus on integrating behavior supports to maximize student learning and motivation is exactly what has been shown to work. This book's utility is not surprising, considering the authors were all teachers prior to becoming leading reading researchers. It really bridges the research-to-practice gap!"--Beth Harn, PhD, Special Education Program, University of Oregon<br><br> "This is one of those rare books that makes scientific reading research interpretable and actionable for practitioners. Not only do the authors present the 'what' and 'how' of intensive reading intervention, but they provide clear, teacher-friendly guidance that permits immediate implementation. Teachers and school leaders will benefit from the book's level of description, numerous examples, and practical recommendations for the classroom. It is sure to empower teachers to reach all their students for decades to come."--Dana Brandes, PhD, special education teacher, Northeast Metro 916 Intermediate School District, Minnesota</p><h2>Smoke and Iron (The Great Library)</h2><p><b>To save the Great Library, the unforgettable characters from <i>Ink and Bone</i>, <i>Paper and Fire, </i>and<i> Ash and Quill </i>put themselves in danger in the next thrilling adventure in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br><br>The opening moves of a deadly game have begun. Jess Brightwell has put himself in direct peril, with only his wits and skill to aid him in a game of cat and mouse with the Archivist Magister of the Great Library. With the world catching fire, and words printed on paper the spark that lights rebellion, it falls to smugglers, thieves, and scholars to save a library thousands of years in the making...if they can stay alive long enough to outwit their enemies.</p><p><b>Rachel Caine</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>, and international bestselling author of more than&nbsp;40 novels, including the Great Library series,&nbsp;<i>Prince of Shadows</i>, the Weather Warden series, the Outcast Season series, the Revivalist series, and the Morganville Vampires series.<p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had all started as an exercise to fight the unending boredom of being locked in this Alexandrian prison cell.</p>When Jess Brightwell woke up, he realized that he'd lost track of time. Days blurred here, and he knew it was important to remember how long he'd been trapped, waiting for the axe to fall-or not. So he diligently scratched out a record on the wall using a button from his shirt.<p>Five days. Five days since he'd arrived back in Alexandria, bringing with him Scholar Wolfe and Morgan Hault as his prisoners. They'd been taken off in different directions, and he'd been dumped here to-as they'd said-await the Archivist's pleasure.</p>The Archivist, it seemed, was a very busy man.<p>Once Jess had the days logged, he did the mental exercise of calculating the date, from pure boredom. It took him long, uneasy moments to realize why that date-today-seemed important.</p>And then he remembered and was ashamed it had taken him so long.<p>Today was the anniversary of his brother Liam's death. His elder brother.</p>And today meant that Jess was now older than Liam had ever lived to be. <br><br>He couldn't remember exactly <i>how </i>Liam had died. Could hardly remember his brother at all these days, other than a vague impression of a sharp nose and shaggy blondish hair. He must have watched Liam walk up the stairs of the scaffold and stand as the rope was fixed around his neck.<p>But he couldn't remember that, or watching the drop. Just Liam, hanging. It seemed like a painting viewed at a distance, not a memory.</p><p><i>Wish I could remember</i>, he thought. If Liam had held his head high on the way to his death, if he'd gone up the steps firmly and stood without fear, then maybe Jess would be able to do it, too. Because that was likely to be in his future.</p><p>He closed his eyes and tried to picture it: the cell door opening. Soldiers in High Garda uniforms, the army of the Great Library, waiting stone-faced in the hall. A Scholar to read the text of his choice to him on the way to execution. Perhaps a priest, if he asked for one.</p>But there, his mind went blank. He didn't know how the Archivist would end his life. Would it be a quiet death? Private? A shot in the back? Burial without a marker? Maybe nobody would ever know what had become of him.<p>Or maybe he'd end up facing the noose after all, and the steps up to it. If he could picture himself walking without flinching to his execution, perhaps he could actually <i>do </i>it.</p><p>He knew he ought to be focusing on what he would be saying to the Archivist if he was called, but at this moment, death seemed so close he could touch it, and besides, it was easier to accept failure than to dare to predict success. He'd never been especially superstitious, but imagining triumph now seemed like drawing a target on his back. No reason to offend the Egyptian gods. Not so early.</p><p>He stood up and walked the cell. Cold, barren, with bars and a flat stone shelf that pretended at being a bed. A bare toilet that needed cleaning, and the sharp smell of it was starting to squirm against his skin.</p><p><i>If I had something to read </i>. . . The thought crept in without warning, and he felt it like a personal loss. Not having a book at hand was a worse punishment than most. He was trying not to think about his death, and he was too afraid to think about the fate of Morgan or Scholar Wolfe or anything else . . . except that he could almost hear Scholar Wolfe's dry, acerbic voice telling him, <i>If only you had a brain up to the task, Brightwell, you'd never lack for something to read</i>.</p><p>Jess settled on the stone ledge, closed his eyes, and tried to clearly imagine the first page of one of his favorite books. Nothing came at his command. Just words, jumbled and frantic, that wouldn't sort themselves in order. Better if he imagined writing a letter.</p><p><i>Dear Morgan</i>, he thought. <i>I'm trapped in a holding cell inside the Serapeum, and all I can think of is that I should have done better by you, and all of us. I'm afraid all this is for nothing. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being stupid enough to think I could outwit the Archivist. I love you. Please don't hate me.</i></p><p>That was selfish. She should hate him. He'd sent her back into the Iron Tower, a life sentence of servitude and an unbreakable collar fastened tight around her neck. He'd deceived Scholar Wolfe into a prison far worse than this one, and an inevitable death sentence. He'd betrayed everyone who'd ever trusted him, and for what?</p><p>For cleverness and a probably foolish idea that he could somehow, <i>somehow</i>, pull off a miracle. What gave him the right to even think it?</p><p><i>Clank</i>.</p><p>That was the sound of a key turning in a heavy lock.</p>Jess stood, the chill on his back left by the ledge still lingering like a ghost, and then he came to the bars as the door at the end of the hall opened. He could see the hinges move and the iron door swinging in. It wasn't locked again when it closed. <i>Careless</i>.<p>He listened to the decisive thud of footsteps against the floor, growing louder, and then three High Garda soldiers in black with golden emblems were in front of his cell. They stopped and faced him. The oldest-his close-cut hair a stiff silver brush around his head-barked in common Greek, "Step back from the bars and turn around."</p><p>Jess's skin felt flushed, then cold; he swallowed back a rush of fear and felt his pulse race in a futile attempt to outrun the inevitable. He followed the instructions. <i>They didn't lock the outer door. That's a chance, if I can get by them. </i>He could. He could sweep the legs out from under the first, use that off-balance body to knock back the other two, pull a sidearm free from one of them, shoot at least one, maybe two of them. Luck would dictate whether he'd die in the attempt, but at least he'd die fighting.</p><p><i>I don't want to die, </i>something in him that sounded like a child whispered. <i>Not like Liam. Not on the same day.</i></p><p>And suddenly, he remembered.</p><p>The London sky, iron gray. Light rain had been falling on his child's face. He'd been too short to see his brother ascend anything but the top two steps of the scaffold. Liam had stumbled on the last one, and a guard had steadied him. His brother had been shivering and slow, and he hadn't been brave after all. He'd looked out into the crowd of those gathered, and Jess remembered the searing second of eye contact with his brother before Liam transferred that stare to their father.</p><p>Jess had looked, too. Callum Brightwell had stared back without a flicker of change in his expression, as if his eldest son were a stranger.</p><p>They'd tied Liam's hands. And put a hood over his head.</p><p>A voice in the here and now snapped him out of the memory. "Against the wall. Hands behind your back."</p><p>Jess slowly moved to comply, trying to assess where the other man was . . . and froze when the barrel of a gun pressed against the back of his neck. "I know what you're thinking, son. Don't try it. I'd rather not shoot you for stupidity."</p><p>The guard had a familiar accent-raised near Manchester, most likely. His time in Alexandria had covered his English roots a bit, but it was odd, Jess thought, that he might be killed by one of his countrymen, so far from home. Killed by the English, just like Liam.</p><p>Once a set of Library restraints settled around his wrists and tightened, he felt strangely less shaken. Opportunity was gone now. All his choices had been narrowed to one course. All he had to do now was play it out.</p><p>Jess turned to look at the High Garda soldier. A man with roots from another garden, maybe one closer to Alexandria; the man had a darker complexion, dark eyes, a neat beard, and a compassionate but firm expression on his face. "Am I coming back?" he asked, and wished he hadn't.</p><p>"Likely not," the soldier said. "Wherever you go next, you won't be back here."</p><p>Jess nodded. He closed his eyes for a second and then opened them. Liam had faltered on the stairs. Had trembled. But at the end his elder brother had stood firm in his bonds and hood and waited for death without showing any fear.</p><p>He could do the same.</p><p>"Then, let's go," he said, and forced a grin he hoped looked careless. "I could do with a change of scenery."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>They didn't take him to the gallows. Not immediately, anyway. And though he half feared he'd never see the shot that would kill him from behind, they reached the end of the hall and the unlocked door without incident. <i>Lucky that Captain Santi isn't here to see that breach of security</i>, he thought. Santi would have had someone's head for it. Metaphorically speaking.</p><p>And now he wished he hadn't thought of that, because it added another possible execution method to his imagined deaths.</p><p>It was a long march through quite a number of checkpoints, each strongly manned with soldiers and automata; the sphinxes watched him with suspicious red eyes and flexed their lion claws. Of all the automata he'd faced before-lions, Spartans, once a hawk-headed Egyptian god-these were the ones that most unnerved him. Something about the human pharaoh's face made them especially inhuman. They'd have no trouble tearing him apart in these close quarters, coming as they would from either side.</p><p>Jess added it to his preferred ways not to die and was grateful when the route took them through an iron gate and into dazzling sunlight. Dying in the sun was always better than dying in the dark, wasn't it? He sucked down thick Alexandrian sea air in convulsive breaths and turned his face up to the warmth; as his eyes adjusted, he realized he was being marched through the small ornamental garden that led around to the side of the giant Alexandrian pyramid that held the Scholar Steps. Too brief a walk, one he didn't have much time to savor, before they passed into the darkness of another doorway near the base of the vast, looming structure.</p><p>Then he knew exactly where he was. He'd been here before.</p><p>The guards marched him through a long lobby guarded by gods and monsters in their niches and down a hall inscribed with hieroglyphs to a final door. Another, larger sphinx sat in an alcove, and a warning growl sounded until the soldier in charge held up his wrist to show the gold bracelet there. The sphinx subsided, and the door opened.</p><p>Jess stepped into the outer office of the single most powerful person in the world.</p><p>His guards didn't follow him in. When he looked back, they'd already turned to walk away, and the door was swinging shut.</p><p>There were guards, of course; these wore the distinctive red-slashed uniforms of the High Garda Elite, sworn to the personal protection of the Archivist, and they took custody of him without a word. Jess almost missed his old escort. He'd trained as a High Garda himself, had worn the uniform, had eaten in the same dining hall as those men. The Elites were more akin to fanatics than to soldiers. They had separate quarters. Separate training. And they were dedicated to one man, not to the protection of the Great Library.</p><p>The Elites hardly gave him a glance as they formed a tight cordon around him and marched him through the outer office, where an assistant's desk sat empty, and then through a set of massive double doors decorated with the Library's seal.</p><p>He was escorted to a heavy, ornate chair and pushed into it, and the guards immediately withdrew to stand in the shadows. They went as immobile as automata.</p><p>Jess raised his gaze to find that the head of the Great Library wasn't even bothering to look at him.</p><p>The old man looked different, Jess thought. Grayer, but somehow stronger, too, as if he'd taken up a new exercise regimen. His hair had been cropped close now, and his skin had a darker hue than before, as if he'd spent time out in the sun. Sailing, perhaps. He must have a ship or two at his disposal.</p><p>The Archivist signed official documents with quick scratches of his pen.</p><p>Jess expected to at least have the old man's attention, but the Archivist said nothing. He simply worked. In a moment, a young woman walked in with a silver tray and put a small china cup of strong coffee on the table next to Jess.</p><p>"Can't drink it, love," he said with a shrug of his shoulders, and twisted to show her his bound hands.</p><p>The Archivist sighed without looking up. "Remove his restraints, will you, please?"</p><p>The order was directed at no one in particular, but a guard immediately stepped forward to press his Library bracelet to the shackles, and they snapped apart. Jess handed them over, and the guard took up his invisibility game again. Jess picked up the coffee cup with a fleeting quirk of his lips at the lovely assistant-she was beautiful-and it was only after he saw the hurt in her eyes that he realized he should have remembered her.</p><p>And <i>Brendan </i>Brightwell certainly should have remembered her. He couldn't forget, not for a second, that he was now intent on carrying on an impersonation of his twin brother, and his brother, God help him, had carried on a secret affair with this very same young woman. Whose name he couldn't remember, no matter how he tried.</p><p><i>Get your head in the room</i>, he told himself. He wasn't Jess anymore. Couldn't be. Jess Brightwell was a dead man in Alexandria; he'd come here to set plans in motion, and he'd done it the only way he could: as his brother Brendan. His life now depended on everyone believing that he was his twin, as unlike him as it was possible to be. Sarcastic, sharp, brash, always ready with a grin or a joke or a knife in the ribs.</p><p>He returned his focus to the Archivist Magister, the head of the Great Library of Alexandria, as the old man--still without looking up--said, "Explain why I shouldn't have your head taken off here and now, prisoner."</p></p><h2>Quantum-Touch 2.0 - The New Human: Discovering and Becoming</h2><p><i>Quantum-Touch 2.0&#x2014;The New Human</i> endeavors to significantly enlarge the possibilities of what humans can be and do.

MacDonald (<i>Ordering Your Private World</i>) charts new territory in church growth books by turning what could have been a long list of dos and don'ts into a highly readable, even novelistic, approach to the subject. With himself as narrator, MacDonald creates a cast of church members in their 50s, 60s and 70s who meet each week to discuss where their church has been, is now and should go in the future. All I know is that someone stole my church and I'd like to get it back, says one. MacDonald delves into the feelings of the older generation as they watch new leadership take over, see changes in music and use of technology, and begin to wonder how they will fit in. He challenges their understanding of what the church is, then looks at the early church and the modern church and the many cultural influences that transform Christian spirituality. MacDonald is especially strong when he includes young people's perspectives or brings research to bear on how people view and act on change. This is a challenging, innovative approach to a delicate subject. It's sure to benefit church leaders and members of all ages who dream of a reinvented church. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The result is a well-rounded and absorbing group of seventeen cases on events in foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, terrorism, homeland security, law enforcement, and decision-making support. &nbsp;In addition to their value as discussion cases, the case studies provide an experiential learning environment students can use to employ 27 different structured analytic techniques. &nbsp;Each turnkey case delivers a captivating narrative, discussion questions, recommended readings, and a series of engaging analytic exercises. The detailed Instructor Materials--available as a free PDF download to all readers from the publisher webpage--include notional solutions, key takeaways, and multimedia ancillaries that make teaching and learning effective, efficient, and rewarding. &nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Miller Beebe began thinking about a book of cases during her career as a U.S. Government analyst and manager. This experience, including an assignment as Director for Russia on the National Security Council staff, drove home the need for rigorous and effective approaches to intelligence analysis. It became apparent to her that cases could not only teach important analytic lessons surrounding historical events but also give analysts experience using a question-based thinking approach underpinned by practical techniques to improve their analyses. Now, as owner of Ascendant Analytics, she helps organizations apply such techniques against their specific analytic problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> Randolph H. Pherson, the President of Pherson Associates, teaches critical thinking skills and advanced analytic techniques to analysts in the intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement communities as well as in the private sector. Mr. Pherson completed a 28-year career in the Intelligence Community in 2000, last serving as National Intelligence Officer (NIO) for Latin America. Previously, at the CIA, Mr. Pherson managed the production of intelligence analysis on topics ranging from global instability to Latin America, served on the Inspector General's staff, and developed and implemented a strategic planning process for the CIA as Chief, Strategic Planning and Management Staff under the Deputy Director for Planning and Coordination (ExDir). He was involved in the development of several collaborative computer networks and was an active proponent of alternative futures analytic techniques. Mr. Pherson is the recipient of both the Distinguished Intelligence Medal for his service as NIO for Latin America and the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal. Mr. Pherson received his A.B. from Dartmouth College and an M.A. in International Relations from Yale University.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Fabulae Ab Urbe Condita: Latin Text with Facing Vocabulary and Commentary</h2><p>This book is a graded reader for intermediate level Latin students who have completed their initial study of grammar but desire additional practice before reading authentic Latin authors.

The book delivered a fresh take on history with its wit and unusual detail. Davis now does for young people what his earlier book did for adults. In his trademark question-and-answer style -- peppered with surprising facts, historic reproductions, and Matt Faulkner's lively illustrations -- Davis introduces our ancestors who settled the East and expanded the West, as well as those who had been living here all along.

He blogs regularly at www.dontknowmuch.com.</p>This is a book that makes a rough transition to audio, and listeners who truly don't know much about American history will have a difficult time keeping up. The book is primarily in question-and-answer format with various narrators voicing the questions and Oliver Wyman reading answers that are filled with dates, times, places, and lists. Wyman reads expressively and enthusiastically but also too quickly. The pace, combined with the lack of musical interludes or even a bit of dead air between segments, makes it difficult for listeners to absorb the information. While the production will have fans, it's not first-rate.

Carl Orff devoted much of his life to music for children. His pioneering work continues under the guidance of teachers and educators in many countries. The five basic German volumes of &#34;Music for Children&#34; by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman were published between 1950 and 1954. The considerable growth of Orff-Schulwerk in the United States led to the publication of the American Edition (1977) to satisfy the requirements of a different educational system and national heritage. Music for Children is a stimulating source of material for music teaching.

Synthetic biology, in which living organisms are selectively altered by modifying substantial portions of their genomes, allows for the creation of entirely new species of organisms. These technologies-far from the out-of-control nightmare depicted in science fiction-have the power to improve human and animal health, increase our intelligence, enhance our memory, and even extend our life span.

Elizabeth and her husband, Jim, are parents and grandparents, and have been active in ministry for more than 30 years.</p>The Proverbs 31 Woman. Since time immemorial, pastors and theologians have weighed in on the valiant woman of Proverbs 31, finding in the acrostic Hebrew poem a recipe for a perfect wife. New England minister Matthew Henry wrote in the 18th century, for example, that the biblical passage showed that a woman should keep to her sphere: She applies herself to the business that is proper for her. It is not in a scholar's business, or statesman's business, that she employs herself, but in women's business; She seeks wool and flax. In recent years, feminists have recovered other aspects of the Proverbs 31 ideal, noting that the woman was an entrepreneur, household manager and ancient real estate agent. In Discovering the Treasures of a Godly Woman, Elizabeth George offers a fairly balanced Bible study about Proverbs 31, stressing traditional interpretations while also emphasizing the heroine's many strengths.

When so much is wrong in the world, when our lives are troubled by so many threats, both real and imagined, we must learn to look to God and to see all things, including ourselves, in the light of who he is. A life of faithful contemplation begins to free us from the bad desires, false expectations, and corrupting illusions that bind us against our will and keep us from the fullness promised in the gospel.</p><p>Chris E.

As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.<p><b>Hans </b>and <b>Margret Rey </b>created many books during their lives together, including&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, one of the most treasured classics of all time, as well as other favorites like&nbsp;<i>Spotty&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Pretzel.</i>&nbsp;But it was their rambunctious little monkey who became an instantly recognizable icon. After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>A Table in the Wilderness: Daily Devotional Meditations from the Ministry of Watchman Nee</h2><p>A rich daily devotional with thoughts from the writings of Watchman Nee.</p><p>Watchaman Nee se convirtio al cristianismo en China a la edad de diecisiete anos y comenzo a escribir en el mismo ano.

Tom and Judy Gordon, a young, attractive couple Corey knows, have been found on their patio, each with a bullet in the head. The local police chief, Sylvester Maxwell, wants Corey&#39;s big-city expertise, but Maxwell gets more than he bargained for. The early signs point to a burglary gone wrong. But because the Gordons were biologists at Plum Island, the offshore animal disease research site rumored to be involved in germ warfare, it isn&#39;t long before the media is suggesting that the Gordons stole something very deadly. Suddenly a local double murder becomes a crime with national and worldwide implications. John Corey doesn&#39;t like mysteries, which is why he likes to solve them. His investigations lead him into the lore, legends, and ancient secrets of northern Long Island - more deadly and more dangerous than he could ever have imagined.

Reprint.</p><p>Mark Teague is the award-winning children's book author and illustrator of his own bestselling Dear Mrs. LaRue series, as well as <i>The Sky Is Falling</i>, <i>The Three Little Pigs and the Somewhat Bad Wolf</i>, <i>The Tree House That Jack Built</i> by Bonnie Verburg, and many other humorous picture books. In addition to his prized art for the How Do Dinosaurs . . . series, his illustrated novel, <i>The Doom Machine</i>, received excellent reviews. Mark lives in the Hudson River Valley with his wife and their two daughters.Teague (who illustrated Audrey Wood's The Flying Dragon Room, p. 75) takes the sidelong view of life in this story about Wendell and Floyd, who are chronically late for school. One day it's space creatures that nearly abduct them, on another it's pirates in the neighborhood, and on another it's a plague of frogs that slows their progress schoolward. Their teacher is not amused. ``Absurd! I'm warning you--be here on time tomorrow--or else! And no more crazy excuses!'' Next day, up at the crack of dawn, determined not to let Ms. Gernsblatt down, Wendell recommends a secret shortcut. That shortcut seems to occupy a parallel dimension, one of rain forests and jungle animals, trailing vines and giant mud puddles. Finally, in the distance, they hear the school bell, and, running toward the noise, make it to their seats in the nick of time. This is an invigorating massage to the imagination, luxuriantly set in Teague's tactile acrylic illustrations, dreamlike items painted from worm's- and bird's-eye angles. Readers who have found themselves tardy and lacking suitable excuses will prize the brio of Wendell and Floyd. (Picture book. 5+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status in Picasso's oeuvre. He kept the majority of his sculptures in his private possession during his lifetime, and it was only in the late 1960s that the public became fully aware of this side of his oeuvre. <br><i>Picasso Sculpture</i> presents approximately 150 sculptures--many of them captured in newly commissioned and sometimes multi-view photographs--alongside a selection of works on paper and photographs. Organized into chapters that correspond to distinct periods during which Picasso devoted himself to sculpture, the publication features an introduction by the exhibition curators as well as a richly illustrated documentary chronology focusing on the sculptures included in the exhibition. A comprehensive bibliography and list of historic exhibitions related to Picasso's work in sculpture closes the volume, advancing the understanding of Picasso's practice and lifelong commitment to constant reinvention.</p><p><p><strong>Ann Temkin</strong> is The Marie-Jos�e and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><p><strong>Anne Umland</strong> is The Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller Curator of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA.</p><p><strong>Luise Mahler</strong> is Assistant Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA.</p><p><strong>Virginie Perdrisot</strong> is Curator of Sculpture and Ceramics at the Mus�e national Picasso, Paris.</p>exceptional....

The person who acts upon such a desire is a Bodhisattva. 'S=antideva not only makes plain what the Bodhisattva must do and become, he also invokes the powerful feelings of aspiration that underlie such a commitment, employing language which has inspired Buddists ever since it first appeared. Indeed, his book has long been regarded as one of the most popular accounts of the Buddhist's spiritual path. Important as a manual of training among Mah=ay=ana Buddhists, especially in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, this text continues to be used as the basis for teaching by modern Buddhist teachers.

She had just taken the pins out of her hair and given it a good brush when a soft knocking sounded on the door. &#x201c;Now, who in the world can that be?&#x201d; Nora said, tying her nightcap under her chin as she hurried down the stairs. The Ratcliff residence was a sturdy brick house, three stories high, with a profusion of roses blooming in the garden, and when Nora opened the door, their fragrant scent wafted toward her on the warm, salty air. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she called out, standing barefoot in her long white nightgown and straining her eyes against the gloom. There was nobody in sight. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she called again.<br> <br>A snuffling noise came from one of the large terra-cotta flowerpots that stood on either side of the front door, and hurrying over, Nora Ratcliff found herself looking down into the scrunched-up face of a tiny baby.<br> <br>A blanket of ferns covered the child, and she was nestled in the rich, soft earth, which Nora had been planning to plant lavender in. The baby squished handfuls of soil between her fingers and gazed solemnly up at Nora. She gave a tiny sneeze as an earthworm crawled over her foot. &#x201c;And where in heavens did you come from?&#x201d; Nora said, scooping the child into her arms. She hurried down the path and looked back and forth along Oak Lane.<br> <br>On the other side of the road, huddled under a streetlamp, stood a young woman. Her hair was long and matted. She wore a ragged dress, and Nora could see that her feet were bare. Lifting her head, she looked over at Nora Ratcliff and with a great deal of anguish, choked out, &#x201c;Please take care of my baby,&#x201d; just as a carriage came swaying around the corner.<br> <br>The woman ran off, and Nora stepped back from the curb, cradling the infant close as the Cranfords&#x2019; buggy trotted past. Returning from a late dinner somewhere, no doubt. Mrs. Cranford enjoyed her gossip as much as her food, and the sight of Nora Ratcliff standing outside in her nightgown, clutching a baby to her chest, would certainly set tongues wagging.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep you, little one,&#x201d; Nora said wistfully. Nora&#x2019;s husband, Dr. Ratcliff, had been dead for ten years now, struck down by the influenza. Her parents were long buried, and she had not been blessed with children of her own. The baby reached out and grasped one of the ribbons on Nora&#x2019;s nightcap. She opened her eyes wide, and for a few moments they observed each other. From somewhere deep inside Nora, a vast well of feelings bubbled up, feelings from all the years of trying, and all the babies she couldn&#x2019;t have. It was at that precise instant that Nora Ratcliff suddenly and completely changed her mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall call you Mabel,&#x201d; she announced to the night, &#x201c;after my own mother.&#x201d; And hurrying back up the path, she was met at the door by her two housemaids, Daisy and Flora.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I heard noises,&#x201d; Daisy gasped. &#x201c;Mam, what are you doing out here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what in heaven&#x2019;s name is that?&#x201d; Flora said, her eyes fixed on the bundle in Nora&#x2019;s arms.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is a baby,&#x201d; Nora replied, swooping past them into the library. She nodded at the leather armchair, pulled up in front of the still smoldering fire. Daisy quickly removed a pile of books from the seat, and Nora settled herself into the chair. &#x201c;This is Mabel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I found her in one of the flowerpots outside, and she will be living with me from now on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Daisy opened her mouth, but no words came out.<br> <br>Flora&#x2019;s face turned an angry crimson. &#x201c;In a flowerpot,&#x201d; she squawked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course this will mean more work for you both, but I shall find a good nanny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, mam. I mean yes, mam,&#x201d; Daisy said, grasping the back of the chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is an unusual situation, I am aware of that,&#x201d; Nora remarked, wondering at the sanity of her decision. &#x201c;And if either of you feel the need to leave, I quite understand and will provide you with an excellent reference.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I will be packing my bags and going,&#x201d; Flora said, her whole body wobbling with indignation. &#x201c;You have no idea where that child is from. Living under the same roof as a flowerpot baby. I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; And turning around, Flora marched from the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you be needing a reference too, Daisy?&#x201d; Nora asked with a sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no, mam.&#x201d; Daisy gave her head a vigorous shake. &#x201c;I would never do that, mam. You have always been good to me. And you don&#x2019;t need to go hiring any nursemaids,&#x201d; she added firmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a soft spot for babies.&#x201d;<br> <br>As word of Mabel&#x2019;s arrival spread, tongues most certainly did wag. Nora Ratcliff&#x2019;s baby was the talk of Melton Bay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure you know what you are getting in to?&#x201d; Mrs. Cranford said the following afternoon. There had been a steady stream of ladies visiting the Ratcliff residence, drinking tea and nibbling currant cake while warning Nora of the horrors that awaited her.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is most unusual,&#x201d; Mrs. Fitzwilliam murmured.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is one thing to knit caps for the street urchins but quite another to bring one into your home,&#x201d; Mrs. Cranford advised. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know where the child is from. You know nothing about her. Except that you found her in a flowerpot!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know she needs a home,&#x201d; Nora replied boldly. But the ladies shook their heads in quiet disapproval, whispering behind their fans. And when it became clear that baby Mabel was there to stay, Nora found that the ladies of Melton Bay didn&#x2019;t visit quite so frequently. And in time she had no afternoon callers at all.<br> <br><br> <br>Mabel grew steadily, feeding on the boiled milk and sugar water that Daisy mixed together. Her hair sprouted like thistledown, and she liked to crawl around the house, trying to catch the sunbeams that danced across the rug. Every day she discovered something new, sticking her fingers into spiderwebs, or peeling apart a cabbage to find out what was inside. &#x201c;Inquisitive little monkey, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Daisy would say affectionately, removing Mabel from whatever mischief she had gotten in.<br> <br>Nora believed it was all the good sea air that kept her daughter (for that is how she had come to think of Mabel) so healthy. As Mabel got older, she was often taken down to the beach. She liked to pick the hermit crabs up in her fingers and peer inside their shells. Mabel let them crawl over her legs, and one time popped a crab into her mouth to see if it tasted of the ocean. Little Eliza Cranford and her sisters would squeal in horror at such behavior, refusing to let Mabel join in their games. The nannies of Melton Bay had been instructed to keep their charges away from Mabel, and it was this, more than anything, that broke Nora&#x2019;s heart. Whenever Mabel trotted over to a group of children, wanting to show them her beach finds, they were ushered off to play somewhere else.<br> <br><br> <br>One hot August bank holiday, when Mabel was three, Nora took her to the pier to watch the Punch and Judy show. Mabel loved the little outdoor puppet theater, and they could hear children laughing as they made their way through the crowds. Hordes of day-trippers had taken the steam train into Melton Bay, and Nora held tight to Mabel&#x2019;s hand as they walked. She stopped for a moment in front of a stall selling baskets, letting go of Mabel briefly to examine a wide, flat basket, perfect for carrying roses.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s three shillings,&#x201d; the woman behind the counter said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s lovely,&#x201d; Nora replied, admiring the tightness of the weave. She glanced down to check on Mabel, but there was no sign of her. Nora spun around wildly, her mouth going dry. &#x201c;Mabel?&#x201d; she cried, turning her head back and forth. &#x201c;Mabel? Where are you?&#x201d; The sound of the organ grinder drowned out her words. A little monkey darted through the crowds, holding out a hat for coins. The monkey jumped in front of Nora, but she ignored it, searching for a glimpse of Mabel&#x2019;s yellow bonnet.<br> <br>And there it was, ducking inside the fortune-teller&#x2019;s booth, which had been painted a deep purple color sprinkled with glittery silver stars&#x2014;just the sort of thing to attract a curious little girl. Nora dashed toward the booth. She pushed aside the curtain to see Mabel standing quite still, staring openmouthed at the imposing figure sitting behind a table. A framed certificate announced that this was Madame Lena Sweeny, member of the fortune-tellers&#x2019; guild.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; Madame Sweeny said, in a voice like melted honey.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are not here for a reading,&#x201d; Nora Ratcliff said swiftly, taking in the fortune-teller&#x2019;s purple gown and feather-trimmed witch&#x2019;s hat.<br> <br>Madame Lena Sweeny appeared not to hear. She beckoned to Mabel, who climbed into the chair opposite. Madame Sweeny reached for Mabel&#x2019;s left hand, clasping it between both of hers. Stretching out her swanlike neck, she bent over and gazed into Mabel&#x2019;s palm. Nora watched nervously as the fortune-teller studied the little hand without blinking. Then she sat up and beckoned to Nora. &#x201c;Please, show me yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really didn&#x2019;t come in for a reading,&#x201d; Nora said, but she nevertheless picked up Mabel and placed the child squarely on her knees, holding out her own hand. Once again, Madame Sweeny extended her neck and gracefully lowered her head, contemplating Nora&#x2019;s palm. Suddenly nervous about what she might be told, Nora Ratcliff could feel her heart pounding as Madame Sweeny ran her fingers lightly across her skin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does your husband have a history of magic in his family?&#x201d; she murmured.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good heavens, no.&#x201d; Nora laughed nervously. &#x201c;None whatsoever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then this child is not yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What on earth do you mean? Of course Mabel belongs to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Madame Sweeny lifted her gaze. &#x201c;This child has magic running in her veins.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Magic?&#x201d; Nora swallowed, feeling her heart palpitations speed up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Strong magic,&#x201d; Madame Sweeny replied. &#x201c;You say it doesn&#x2019;t come from your husband&#x2019;s side, and yet your palm reveals that you have not a drop of magical blood. It often skips generations, many generations, but there is no trace of witchcraft in your family line.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My father always said we were a practical lot,&#x201d; Nora confirmed, &#x201c;had our feet planted firmly on the ground. . . . I probably have soil running in my veins,&#x201d; she added, trying to make light of the conversation.<br> <br>Madame Sweeny didn&#x2019;t smile. &#x201c;Sometime in the next few years,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;this little girl will show signs of her gift.&#x201d; She leaned forward, tapping her long pointed nails on the table. &#x201c;Be aware that magic is often triggered by a keen passion, when the child is doing something she loves and feels excited about. She may start to lift off the ground,&#x201d; Madame Sweeny warned. &#x201c;Or send objects floating around the room. Things may spark when she touches them, or change color. Magic in children is extremely unstable until they have learned to control it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what do I do?&#x201d; Nora questioned rather anxiously. &#x201c;Having no experience with witchcraft myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch her closely,&#x201d; Madame Sweeny advised in a somber voice. &#x201c;She has an inquisitive nature to go with her magic, and that can be a dangerous combination.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Girl Who Could Move Sh*t with Her Mind (The Frost Files, 1)</h2><p><b>Full of imagination, wit, and random sh*t flying through the air, this insane adventure </b><b>from an irreverent new voice will blow your tiny mind.</b><b><br></b><b>For Teagan Frost, sh*t just got real.</b><b><br></b><b> </b>Teagan Frost is having a hard time keeping it together.

Domesticated since the dawn of man, they&#x2019;ve been used as crucial communicators in war by every major historical superpower from ancient Egypt to the United States and are credited with saving thousands of lives. Charles Darwin relied heavily on pigeons to help formulate and support his theory of evolution. Yet today they are reviled as rats with wings.&#x201d; Author Andrew D. Blechman traveled across the United States and Europe to meet with pigeon fanciers and pigeon haters in a quest to find out how we came to misunderstand one of mankind&#x2019;s most helpful and steadfast companions. Pigeons captures a Brooklyn man&#x2019;s quest to win the Main Event (the pigeon world&#x2019;s equivalent of the Kentucky Derby), as well as a convention dedicated to breeding the perfect bird. Blechman participates in a live pigeon shoot where entrants pay $150; he tracks down Mike Tyson, the nation&#x2019;s most famous pigeon lover; he spends time with Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s Royal Pigeon Handler; and he sheds light on a radical pro-pigeon underground&#x2019; in New York City. In <i>Pigeons</i>, Blechman tells for the first time the remarkable story behind this seemingly unremarkable bird.</p><p>Many people consider the ubiquitous rock dove, better known as the pigeon, a "rat with wings." But as Blechman demonstrates in his enjoyable and informative book, this much maligned bird has served humans well for thousands of years, carrying messages informing the ancient Egyptians about flood levels along the Nile, bearing news of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo and saving thousands of soldiers' lives during the two world wars. Today pigeons are found everywhere, from the queen of England's luxurious racing pigeon lofts to the garbage-strewn streets of every large city. Pigeons&#x2014;gregarious, easily domesticated and capable of flying for hours at speeds of more than 100 mph&#x2014;are interesting in their own right, but Blechman writes not so much about the birds themselves as about the people who either love or hate them. These include members of a Newe York City homing pigeon club who dedicate themselves to raising and racing pigeons; Queen Elizabeth's royal pigeon handler; breeders who spend years perfecting champion birds for show; gun enthusiasts who participate in brutal live pigeon shoots. Many of these people are eccentric, and while Blechman's book won't convert pigeon haters to pigeon lovers, it does make for entertaining reading. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When they are noticed, they are thought of as feathered rats, and yet there are enthusiastic clubs that race homing pigeons, breed fancy pigeons, and keep coops of birds on their roofs. From the Main Event (the Kentucky Derby of pigeon racing) to the Grand Nationals (think Westminster Kennel Club with pigeons), the author delves into the world of pigeon fanciers and learns from some of its gurus. Along the way, Blechman examines genetics and evolution (Darwin based much of his theory on his own pigeon breeding), history (carrier pigeons saved thousands of lives during the World Wars), natural history (how pigeons "home"), mythology (pigeons as symbols of peace and fertility), and pigeon control (both humane and lethal). Readers will never look at their cities' pigeons the same way again. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now, over forty years later, Asatru (an Icelandic word that means true to the Gods) is one of the fastest growing new religious movements in America. In Asatru: A Native European Spirituality, McNallen describes the origins and development of Asatru, its kinship with other tribal and ethnic religions, and the cosmological and philosophical underpinnings of this dynamic and inspiring faith. He outlines the rituals, seasonal festivals, and code of ethics embraced by modern practitioners of Asatru. More importantly, McNallen explains his vision of what Asatru can and must become. Asatru is more than just another empty offering on the spiritual smorgasbord of post-religious America. For men and women of European descent, Asatru is the key to unlocking our vibrant spiritual heritage.</p><p>Stephen A. McNallen has been a soldier, a journalist, and a schoolteacher. He has travelled the world, from Burma to Bosnia, in search of insight and adventure. In 1971, McNallen founded the Viking Brotherhood, the first legally recognized religious organization dedicated to the Gods and Goddesses of Northern Europe. Today, McNallen is the head of the Asatru Folk Assembly, the preeminent Asatru organization on the North American continent. A proud native Texan, Steve McNallen currently resides in Northern California with his wife, Sheila.Asatru is a Native European spirituality and as such has far more in common with Native American religions or the Shintoism of the Japanese people than it does universalist religions such as Christianity. Navajo spirituality is primarily for Navajos . . . the spirituality and the ethnicity of the people who practice it are indivisible parts of a whole.The same holds true for Asatru. As such, it is at least as much about who we are as what we believe. This book is the literary distillation of more than four decades of experience and will be highly informative and inspirational to both newcomers and those who have been involved in Asatru for many years.There could be no better single book for the beginner on this path as all the aspects of Asatru are explained with great clarity. --Richard Rudgley, author of Pagan Resurrection: A Force for Evil or the Future of Western Spirituality?<br><br>Years in the making, this book represents the distillation of a lifetime of work by the most significant single figure in the history of the revival of the Norse Gods and Goddesses in modern America. Any and all who are interested in the tribal religion of our ancestors need to have this book in their libraries. --Edred Thorsson, author of ALU: An Advanced Guide to Operative Runology<br><br>Stephen McNallen is known to all followers of the Northern Tradition as a stalwart upholder of Asatru of many years standing. This book is his compelling vision of the ancient northern spiritual tradition, a fine introduction to Asatru for all followers of the old Gods and seekers after spiritual enlightenment. --Nigel Pennick, author of Pagan Magic of the Northern Tradition: Customs, Rites, and Ceremonies</p><h2>Life Among the Apaches: The Classic History of Native American Life on the Plains</h2><p><b>One of the original seventeenth-century historical accounts of the Apaches and the southwestern American Indians.</b><br><br>John C. Cremony&#x2019;s first encounter with the Indians of the Southwest occurred in the early 1850s, when he accompanied John R. Bartlett&#x2019;s boundary commission surveying the United States Mexican border. Some ten years later, as an officer of the California Volunteers, he renewed his acquaintance, particularly with the Apaches, whom he came to know as few white Americans before him had. Cremony was the first white man to become fluent in the Apache language, and he published the first dictionary of their language as a tool for the US Army.<br><br>Cremony&#x2019;s account of his experiences, published in 1868, quickly became, and remains today, an indispensable source on Apache beliefs, tribal life, and fighting tactics. Although its original purpose was to induce more effective military suppression of the Apaches, it has all the fast-paced action and excitement of a novel and the authenticity of an ethnographic and historical document. Life Among the Apaches is unrivaled in its attention to detail, and Cremony&#x2019;s firsthand accounts of the intricacies of daily life for the Apaches make it both an essential text on Native American culture and a truly important anthropological work.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</p><p><b>John C. Cremony</b> was an American newspaperman who also served as a lieutenant in the Regiment California Volunteer Cavalry.

Utley</p><h2>Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government, 25th Anniversary Edition (Independent Studies in Political Economy)</h2><p><p>Discussing how government has continually grown in size and scope during the past century, this account demonstrates that the main reason lies in government&#x2019;s responses to national &#x201c;crises&#x201d; (real or imagined), including economic upheavals and, especially, war. The result, this book argues, is the ever-increasing government power, which endures long after each crisis has passed, impinging on both civil and economic liberties and fostering extensive corporate welfare. Offering ideological explanations for the ascension of the role of government out of a capitalist, free-market economy, it will appeal to those with interests in political economy, American history, and libertarian politics.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Higgs</b> is senior fellow in political economy for the Independent Institute and the editor of the Institute&#x2019;s quarterly journal, the<i> Independent Review</i>. He is also the author of several books, including <i>Against Leviathan</i>, <i>Competition and Coercion</i>, <i>Neither Liberty Nor Safety</i>, <i>Resurgence of the Warfare State</i>, and <i>The Transformation of the American Economy 1865&#x2013;1914, </i>and the recipient of numerous awards, such as the Gary Schlarbaum Award for Lifetime Defense of Liberty and the Lysander Spooner Award for Advancing&nbsp;the Literature of Liberty.<i> </i>He lives in Covington, Louisiana. <b>Arthur A.

Essentially he proposes that government control, which increases during a war or economic depression, continues after the crisis, with each increase influencing the prevailing ideology, making further increases more acceptable to the public. The process involves government taking on new functions more than expanding traditional ones. Because of this ratchet-like movement toward ever bigger government, Higgs is somewhat pessimistic about the survival of individual rights and a free society.

At the eye of the storm is one secret that threatens to shake their lives -- even destroy them.<br><br>Set on stormy Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia, <i>Fall on Your Knees</i> is an internationally acclaimed multigenerational saga that chronicles the lives of four unforgettable sisters.

This epic tale of family history, family secrets, and music centers on four sisters and their relationships with each other and with their father. Set in the coal-mining communities of Nova Scotia in the early part of this century, the story also shifts to the battlefields of World War I and the jazz scene of New York City in the 1920s."Magnetic&#x2026; a dizzying leap into a mind so rich and complex you spend almost as much time marvelling how she got there as enjoying the results&#x2026; Compelling and original&#x2026; MacDonald succeeds brilliantly in building a world that, at least for the satisfying length of time it takes to finish <b>Fall On Your Knees</b>, gloriously supersedes all else." -- <i>Financial Post</i> <br> <br>"Beautiful&#x2026; this big, bold, epic shocker of a novel reads as if John Irving met Joyce Carol Oates.

A standout." -- <i>Vancouver Sun<br><br></i>"MacDonald is a master of exciting story-telling, of suspense and surprise." -- <i>The Montreal Gazette<br><br></i>"... a narrative presence that can look at the unbearable, and sustain the emotion of it, and deliver it up edged in mordant wit." -- EDITOR'S CHOICE, Notable Books of 1996, <i>The Globe and Mail</i> <br> <i><br></i>"... a multi-generational saga ... carried off with great assurance and style." -- Philip Marchand, CRITIC'S CHOICE, <i>The Toronto Star<br><br></i>"... utterly compelling -- a brilliant take on the black themes of racism, physical and emotional battery, sexual abuse, suicide, and murder." -- <i>The Vancouver Review<br><br></i>"Stunning...The book and the talent behind it are big.

Featuring 60 beautiful and detailed maps of the empires&#39; territories at different stages of their existence and organized thematically to reflect the different driving forces behind empires throughout history (such as faith, nomadic culture, nationhood and capitalism), each section discusses the rise and fall of the empires that existed in a region: their government and society, wealth and technology, war and military force, and religious beliefs. From the earliest empires of the Sumerians and the Pharaohs to the modern empires of the USSR and the European Union, this is a story that reveals how empires are created and organized, how later empires resolve the problems of governance faced by earlier empires, and how the political and cultural legacies of ancient empires are still felt today.</p><p>Peter Davidson is a freelance writer and has been, among other things, a restorer of antiquities from around the world, a writer and director of documentaries on World War II and related subjects for the History Channel, and a tutor on the Politics, Philosophy and History degree at Birkbeck College, University of London. He is the co-author of Milestones of Civilization.Booklist: Essentially covering 4,000 years of world history, this new work by History Channel writer Davidson takes a textbook-like approach, using gorgeous and detailed maps and clearly written text to tell the story of the great empires of world history. Thematically, rather than chronologically, organized, each chapter focuses on the rise and fall of a particular empire by examining the motives for expansion (economic, martial, or evangelical), the resistance or collaboration of the colonized, and the overall international situation at the time. Also discussed are the ways in which the legacy of collapsed empires affects the establishment and governance of subsequent empires, resonating up to the present day. Recommended for all types of libraries. --Michael Tosko<br><br>From Broken Teepee History Blog:<br><br>My degree is in history &#x2013; European History &#x2013; but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t have a deep and abiding love of that which came before. Researching the rise, and fall of the Great Empires through time has a lot to teach us if we would only bother to learn. This book is not the type of book you just sit down and read as you would a novel or biography. At least I didn&#x2019;t. I just kept it on my reading table and I&#x2019;d pick it up, choose an era and get myself lost in the history. It is richly illustrated and just deep enough to stir the interest for deeper reading if an empire should intrigue.<br><br>As it is a book that covers so much you can&#x2019;t expect a deep dive on each period in history but the book offers the most import aspects of the Empire&#x2019;s timeline. It provides what you need to know so that if you want to learn more you now have a grounding and an excellent starting point for moving forward. I truly found it to be very well written and I&#x2019;m glad to have it.<br><br>RATING:<br>5<br><br>Roman Times: Davidson does a good job of defining and describing key cultural characteristics of each empire and the inherent challenges their leaders faced. He also astutely defines the strengths and weaknesses of each and how these either helped it to achieve greatness or resulted in its ultimate decline and destruction.<br><br>I have recently tucked into my travel-slash-history book library the 240-page "Atlas of Empires: The World's Civilizations from Ancient Times to Today" and have already referred to it regarding upcoming trips.

He also is a restorer of antiquities from around the world. "Atlas of Empires" (Fox Chapel Publishing, Mount Joy, Lancaster County) addresses the rise and fall of empires from the Pharaohs and Sumerians to the USSR and the European Union.

In this "town-eat-town" futuristic world, cities on wheels continue to overpower and devour smaller or weaker cities. Tom and Hester are persuaded to take Pennyroyal, a renowned explorer and adventurer, aboard their airship as a passenger. When they are pursued and fired upon by Green Storm fighter airships bent on destroying all traction cities and city people, the teens are forced to land on Anchorage, a traction city in the Ice Wastes region. This once-wealthy city is now sparsely populated since the majority of its inhabitants have died of the plague. Freya, the last of the royal family line, is the unlikely ruler, a petulant girl of 16. She believes Pennyroyal's tales of having seen green, fertile areas in the otherwise "Dead Continent" of America and rashly decides that her traction city will go there. Hester's jealousy of Tom's infatuation for Freya's plump prettiness compels her to commit an act of betrayal that sets a series of events in motion that includes murder, intrigue, revenge, daring rescues, kidnapping, torture, "lost boys," and resurrection of the dead. This exciting and compelling novel unfolds at breakneck speed with abundant plots and characters but readers won't have any trouble following along. It has more humor and fewer deaths than its predecessor but the characters continue to find themselves in moral quagmires.

When couples are able to do this, each partner invariably develops new insight and also discovers that speaking from the Self on behalf of (rather than from) both protective and vulnerable parts produces an entirely different response from the partner."<b> Richard C.

This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data.<br><br>After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem. </p><p>The book is accessible to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with a summary of the most important technical concepts.</p></p><p>Jonas Peters is Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of Copenhagen.<p><i>Elements of Causal Inference</i> is an important contribution to the growing literature on causal analysis.

He was right. "The Battle of Britain" was a crucial turning point in the history of the Second World War and now, acclaimed British historian James Holland has written the definitive account of this battle based on extensive new research from around the world including thousands of new interviews with people on both sides of the fighting. </p><p>Had Britain's defenses collapsed, Hitler would have dominated all of Europe and been able to turn his full attention east to the Soviet Union. The German invasion of France and the Low Countries in May 1940 was unlike any the world had ever seen. It hit with a force and aggression that no-one could counter and in just a few short weeks, all in their way crumbled under the force of the Nazi hammer blow. With France facing defeat and with British forces pressed back to the Channel, there were few who believed Britain could possibly survive. Soon, it seemed, Hitler would have all of Europe at his feet. Yet Hitler's forces were not quite the Goliath they at first seemed, while her leadership lacked the single-minded purpose, vision and direction that had led to such success on land. Nor was Britain any David. Thanks to a sophisticated defensive system and the combined efforts of the RAF, Royal Navy as well as the mounting sense of collective defiance led by a new Prime Minister, Britain was not ready to give in to the Nazi onslaught. </p><p>From clashes between coastal convoys and Schnellboote in the Channel to astonishing last stands in Flanders, and from the slaughter by the U-boats in the icy Atlantic to the dramatic aerial battles over England, James Holland's The Battle of Britain paints a complete picture of that extraordinary summer - a time in which the fate of the world truly hung by a thread.</p></p><p><p>James Holland was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and studied history at Durham University. A member of the British Commission for Military History and the Guild of Battlefield Guides, he also regularly contributes reviews and articles in national newspapers and magazines. He is the author of <i>Italy</i><i>'s Sorrow: A Year of War, 1944-1945</i>; <i>Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege, 1940-1943; Together We Stand: North Africa 1942-1943 &#x2013; Turning the Tide in the West; </i>and <i>Heroes: The Greatest Generation and the Second World War. </i>His many interviews with veterans of the Second World War are available at the Imperial War Museum. James Holland is married with two children and lives in Wiltshire.</p>THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN (Chapter 1)First Flight <p>SUNDAY, 5 MAY 1940, a little after two that afternoon. A warm, sunny day over much of Britain, but above Drem aerodrome, a busy grass airfield some twenty miles east of Edinburgh, a deep blue sky was pock-marked with bright white cumulus drifting lazily across the Scottish headland on a gentle breeze. Perfect flying weather, in fact, which was just as well because Pilot Officer David Crook could barely contain his excitement any longer.</p> <p>Dispersed around one end of the airfield, beside the concrete perimeter track, were the twelve Spitfires of 609 (West Riding) Squadron. Elsewhere, further along around the airfield&#x2019;s edge, were more Spitfires, as well as various other aircraft, including a number of Harvard and Magister trainers. Clutching his leather flying helmet and parachute, David followed his friend and flight commander, Pip Barran, from the wooden dispersal hut towards the line of Spitfires. Groundcrew were busy around several of them, including L.1083, a Mk IA, and one of four that had been delivered to the squadron at the end of the previous August.</p> <p>David had missed their arrival, although he had seen the squadron&#x2019;s first two Spits land at 609&#x2019;s pre-war base at Yeadon in Yorkshire on 19 August &#x2013; just a few days after their last peacetime summer camp had ended. Flying ageing Hawker Hind biplanes had been grand enough fun, but the news that the squadron was to convert to Spitfires had been greeted with euphoria by all concerned. Like any man or boy alive, David had wanted to fly one of these beautiful machines ever since he had first heard about them. With its powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and sleek, curving lines, the Spitfire was an ultra-modern machine of barely imaginable power. Moreover, its heritage could not be bettered; Supermarine, its maker, had won the Schneider Trophy &#x2013; the award given to the fastest aircraft in the world &#x2013; a decade or so before for the third consecutive time.</p> <p>Although an Auxiliary Air Force squadron made up of &#x2018;weekend fliers&#x2019;, 609 had been mobilized shortly before the outbreak of war. Yet while some of the more experienced pilots had headed straight to Catterick in anticipation of the beginning of hostilities, David and five other Auxiliary pupil pilots had been left behind, first to kick their heels for a month at Yeadon, and then to be sent to complete their flying training.</p> <p>David had finished his training just a fortnight before, and his leave the previous day. Of the six that had been sent to Flying Training School (FTS), only four were now returning to 609. Two of them, Gordon Mitchell and Michael Appleby, had driven up to Scotland with David the day before, having all met up for lunch in Leeds. They had stopped again for dinner in Alnwick, before finally arriving at Drem in time for reunion drinks in the mess.</p> <p>It had been good to be back amongst his old friends once more, although there were a number of new faces too, including three regular RAF pilots and four members of the Volunteer Reserve. At first glance they had seemed decent enough, however, and David had been pleased to notice that, despite a new CO, the old atmosphere of 609 was little changed. And Drem seemed like a good spot, with enough hangars and activity to whet the enthusiasm of any keen young pilot, and plenty of golf nearby, as well as tennis and squash courts. Furthermore, Edinburgh, with its mass of pubs and entertainments, was just a short drive away.</p> <p>Best of all, however, was the prospect of spending many happy hours flying Spitfires. At last! And Pip had been quick to put him out of his misery. A half-hour flight in a Harvard in the morning and then he and the others had been given the all-clear to take the Spitfire up.</p> <p>The wheels of the petrol bowser had left their impression in the grass and the smell of high-octane aviation fuel was still strong as David and Pip reached L.1083. The two groundcrew &#x2013; the plane&#x2019;s fitter and rigger &#x2013; were still finishing preparing the aircraft for flight as Pip led David around the Spitfire for the external checks, stepping carefully over the lead from the accumulator trolley that fed into the cowling. With his helmet now on, and his parachute strapped and dangling slightly from his backside, David then climbed on to the root of the port wing and, at Pip&#x2019;s instruction, hoisted himself over the half-door and down into the cockpit. Clambering on to the wing beside him, Pip then talked him through any unfamiliar aspects of the plane, reminded him of the settings, and then, with a cheery smile, jumped down and left him to it.</p> <p>David kept the rounded canopy pushed back behind his seat as he clipped his radio leads on to his helmet. The cockpit was narrow &#x2013; just three feet wide &#x2013; but even for a man of decent height and build like David it did not feel cramped: he could move his arms easily enough, while his feet rested comfortably on the pale green metal pedals. The smell was distinctive &#x2013; as it was in all aircraft; a mixture of oil, metal, hydraulic fluid, sweat, rubber and fuel. Not unpleasant at all; reassuring, rather.</p> <p>Elevator set, rudder fully pushed to the right. Flaps up, artificial horizon set. With his left hand, David set the throttle next to his knee to the start-up position, switched on the radio button and then, with his right hand, turned the engine start isolation switch to &#x2018;on&#x2019;. He unscrewed the priming plunger locknut and began priming the engine. Magneto switches on. Fuel selector on. Glancing out, he saw the groundcrew, then he leaned forward slightly to the bottom centre of the panel and with the index and middle fingers of his right hand simultaneously pressed the engine start and booster coil buttons. As the engine began to turn he vigorously worked the priming pump until, after a few seconds, and with a lick of flame and a belch of smoke from the exhaust stubs, the mighty Merlin roared into life. He carried out his magneto checks, then gave a nod to the groundcrew, who now pulled the chocks clear. A voice from control &#x2013; he was clear to roll.</p> <p>The noise was incredible. The airframe was shaking, the engine growling angrily, so that even though the sound was muffled by his tightly fitting flying helmet and earpieces, it was still a throbbing roar. In front of him, blocking his forward view entirely, was the engine cowling, pointing imperiously skywards, the propeller a faint whirr. Glancing out, he saw the groundcrew unplug the lead from the accumulator trolley and pull it clear. Then hearing the static-distorted voice of the ground controller give him the all-clear, he acknowledged, released the brakes and felt the Spitfire roll forward.</p> <p>Zig-zagging slowly so that he could see what was ahead of him, he successfully manoeuvred the beast to the end of the grass runway and then paused one more time to check that everything was OK. Engine temperature was already 100 degrees &#x2013; it had risen alarmingly quickly. He glanced again at the dials, tightened the primer locknut, and then opened the throttle.</p> <p>The effect took his breath away. The engine powered up with a smooth roar and the Spitfire leapt forward like a bullet, the fuselage almost trying to twist from the huge torque from the Merlin. Easing the stick forward slightly as he&#x2019;d been told to do, he felt the fuselage rise and the cowling lower so that at last he could see ahead of him. Then, before David barely knew what was happening, the Spitfire was hurtling at ninety miles per hour and then the shuddering along the ground stopped and he felt the plane slip seamlessly into the air. He had never known such power; it was like driving a Grand Prix racing car having just stepped out of an ageing Morris and for a moment he felt as though the machine was completely running away with him.</p> <p>As he continued to climb, he managed to collect his scattered wits, raised the undercarriage, made sure the temperatures and pressure were stabilized, and then turned the propeller to coarse pitch. Glancing backwards, he was astonished to see the airfield already far, far behind him. It was hard not to smile.</p> <p>After cruising over the Lothians for a few minutes, however, David began to realize that his Spitfire was perhaps not quite as formidable as he had first thought during the first breathless moments, so with his confidence rising he decided to take the plane back for a bumps and circuit. This he managed without too much difficulty, touching back down and then promptly taking off again and feeling altogether more comfortable.</p> <p>Climbing high into the clouds in this remarkable new toy he swirled and pirouetted through the early-summer sky, performing gentle dives that saw his air speed indicator rise to as much as 400 miles per hour. It was fabulously thrilling, a brief time of unbridled joy. As he was very quickly discovering, it did not take long to become accustomed to the Spitfire&#x2019;s great power and speed, and once this adjustment had been made, it was an extraordinarily easy machine to fly and a quite superb aircraft for performing aerobatics.</p> <p>After an hour he landed back at Drem, rolling the Spitfire across the grass to its dispersal around the perimeter. Having shut down the engine, he pushed back the canopy once more. He felt quite light-headed with exhilaration; his life irrevocably changed. &#x2018;Practically everybody who has flown a Spitfire thinks it is the most marvellous aircraft ever built,&#x2019; he noted, &#x2018;and I am no exception to the rule.&#x2019;</p> <p>Not for nothing was the RAF known as the best flying club in the world. By the beginning of the war, flying was still a comparatively new phenomenon, and those fortunate enough to get their chance to take to the air found largely empty skies in which the world seemed to be their oyster. For David, a 25-year-old sport-loving Yorkshireman, the Auxiliary Air Force had meant that he could work in the family sports goods manufacturing business in Huddersfield by week and fly at the weekend with lots of like-minded friends. Although being in the air force had, with the onset of war, become a full-time occupation, David was enjoying himself enormously, despite having to leave his young wife at home. At FTS he had made even more friends, was finding flying as rewarding and exhilarating as ever, and now, at the beginning of May, had finally been given the chance of a lifetime: to fly the already fabled Spitfire.

In an easy-to-use format, <i>Your Complete Guide to the Arizona National Scenic Trail</i> features the 800-mile trail, section by section (43 passages altogether) so that day-hikers, thru-hikers, mountain bikers, runners, and equestrians can feel confident about finding the trailheads, navigating the route, and connecting with the awe-inspiring landscape like never before. Inspired by the magnificence of the scenery, wildlife, and diversity of terrain, this new book is an irreplaceable source for everyone interested in the Arizona National Scenic Trail.</p><p>Arizona evokes images of breathtaking landscapes, exotic animals, star-filled skies, and dramatic sunsets. Even for those who have never traveled through this wild part of the West, the very concept of the place suggests mystery, beauty, and allure. Glancing at a map of the state reveals an abundance of national forests, national parks, Native American reservations, and huge tracts of land free of roads, cities, or any semipermanent footprint of modern society. From rolling grasslands and lush Sonoran Desert to alpine peaks and one of the world's deepest canyons, it is a land of biodiversity unlike anywhere else on Earth. This is Arizona.And through its wild heart runs a single trail--an 800-plus-mile path from Mexico to Utah that links mountains, deserts, forests, canyons, rivers, communities, and people. This is the Arizona National Scenic Trail (AZT). One of only 11 National Scenic Trails in the country, and only the third to be completed, the AZT beckons the adventurous at heart to explore the more remote and unknown regions of the state. But it also winds through the Grand Canyon, Saguaro National Park, and other famous natural wonders.Just because there is a trail through the entire state does not mean it's easily accessible every step of the way. While trailheads and signs exist, the AZT experience is intended to be a personal encounter with nature on its own terms. Unlike other long-distance trails, the AZT offers the possibility of your going for days without seeing humans other than your own companions. Many miles unfold between resupply services on some AZT passages. In fact, you might even forget that "civilization" exists.What you will need on this journey in the Grand Canyon State is a reliable guidebook, especially if you want to get to know Arizona a little more intimately. And now you have it--Your Complete Guide to the Arizona National Scenic Trail. Whether you plan to attempt the entire AZT in one crossing or, like most trail enthusiasts, will spend the next decade section-hiking (or section-biking or section-horseback-riding) the trail one passage at a time, this book will help you plan and navigate appropriately. We also created it to inform, entertain, and inspire you.Directions in these pages will lead you to trailheads, water sources, and the twists and turns you will need to stay on the trail and keep from getting lost. You'll also find profiles on Gateway Communities--the small towns near the trail where you can make segues to basic supplies (such as Advil and peanut butter) and sustenance and services (Mexican food and massage therapy, for instance).&nbsp;We've also included information about Arizona's geology and botany. The more you learn about the forces that shaped this wild landscape and the organisms that have adapted to live here, the more you'll become enamored with Arizona. Most of all, we hope you enjoy the AZT.&nbsp;And in the words of the late, great Edward Abbey (as he wrote in Desert Solitaire), "May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view . . . where storms come and go as lightning clangs upon the high crags, where something strange and more beautiful and more full of wonder than your deepest dreams waits for you. . . ."Primary editor and executive director of the Arizona Trail Association, <b>Matthew J.

But that year, at age forty-two, he found his footing again, finishing a play he had begun the previous autumn&#x2014;<i>King Lear</i>&#x2014;then writing two other great tragedies, <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>.<br> <br>It was a memorable year in England as well&#x2014;a terrorist plot conceived by a small group of Catholic gentry had been uncovered at the last hour. The foiled Gunpowder Plot would have blown up the king and royal family along with the nation&#x2019;s political and religious leadership. The aborted plot renewed anti-Catholic sentiment and laid bare divisions in the kingdom.<br> <br>It was against this background that Shakespeare finished <i>Lear</i>, a play about a divided kingdom, then wrote a tragedy that turned on the murder of a Scottish king, <i>Macbeth</i>. He ended this astonishing year with a third masterpiece no less steeped in current events and concerns: <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exciting and sometimes revelatory, in <i>The Year of Lear,</i> James Shapiro takes a closer look at the political and social turmoil that contributed to the creation of three supreme masterpieces&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>). He places them in the context of their times, while also allowing us greater insight into how Shakespeare was personally touched by such events as a terrible outbreak of plague and growing religious divisions. &#x201c;His great gift is to make the plays seem at once more comprehensible and more staggering&#x201d; (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>). For anyone interested in Shakespeare, this is an indispensable book.</p><p>James Shapiro is the Larry Miller Professor of English at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1985.

He lives in New York with his wife and son.The Year of Lear 1<p></p> <br><br> THE KING&#x2019;S MAN<p></p> <br>In the summer of 1605 John Wright began selling copies of a newly printed play called The True Chronicle History of King Leir, which had first been staged around 1590. Not long after, William Shakespeare, who lived just a short stroll from Wright&#x2019;s bookshop, picked up a copy. A few years earlier Shakespeare had moved from his lodgings in Southwark, near the Globe Theatre, to quarters in a quieter and more upscale neighborhood, on the corner of Silver and Muggle Streets in Cripplegate. His landlords were Christopher and Marie Mountjoy, Huguenot artisans who made their living supplying fashionable headwear for court ladies. The walk from his new lodgings to Wright&#x2019;s bookshop took just a few minutes. Crossing Silver Street, Shakespeare would have passed his parish church, St. Olave&#x2019;s, before heading south down Noble Street toward St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, passing Goldsmiths&#x2019; Hall as Noble Street turned into Foster Lane, emerging onto the busy thoroughfare of Cheapside. With Cheapside Cross to his left, and St. Paul&#x2019;s and beyond it the Thames directly ahead, Shakespeare would have turned west, passing St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane and then the Shambles, home to London&#x2019;s butchers. Christ Church was now in sight, and just beyond it Wright&#x2019;s shop, abutting Newgate market.<br> <br>The advertisement on the title page of King Leir&#x2014;&#x201c;As it hath been divers and sundry times lately acted&#x201d;&#x2014;made it sound like a recent play, an impression reinforced by the quiet omission of who wrote and performed it. But Shakespeare knew that it was an old Queen&#x2019;s Men&#x2019;s play and probably also knew (though we don&#x2019;t) who had written it. The Queen&#x2019;s Men were a hand-picked all-star troupe formed under royal patronage back in 1583. For the next decade they were England&#x2019;s premier company, touring widely, known for their politics (patriotic and Protestant), their didacticism, and their star comedian, Richard Tarleton. If he wasn&#x2019;t busy acting that day in another playhouse, Shakespeare may have been part of the crowd that paid a total of thirty-eight shillings to see the Queen&#x2019;s Men stage King Leir at the Rose Theatre in Southwark on April 6, 1594 (in coproduction with Lord Sussex&#x2019;s Men), or part of the smaller gathering two days later for a performance that earned twenty-six shillings&#x2014;solid though not spectacular box office receipts.<br> <br>Looking back, Shakespeare would have recognized that their appearance at the Rose marked the beginning of the end for the Queen&#x2019;s Men, who the following month sold off copies of some of their valuable play-scripts to London&#x2019;s publishers, then took to the road, spending the next nine years touring the provinces until, upon the death of Queen Elizabeth, they disbanded. That year also marked the ascendancy of the company Shakespeare had recently joined as a founding shareholder, the Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men, who soon succeeded the Queen&#x2019;s Men as the leading players in the land, a position they had held ever since. King Leir had been among the plays the cash-poor Queen&#x2019;s Men had unloaded in 1594, and Edward White, who bought it, quickly entered his right to publish the play in the Stationers&#x2019; Register. But for some reason, perhaps sensing that the play had little prospect of selling well, White never published it. Over a decade would pass before his former apprentice John Wright obtained the rights from him and the play finally appeared in print.<br> <br>One of the many towns where the Queen&#x2019;s Men had performed in the late 1580s had been Stratford-upon-Avon. In the absence of any information about what Shakespeare was doing in his early twenties, biographers have speculated that he may have begun his theatrical career with this company, perhaps even filling in for one of the Queen&#x2019;s Men, William Knell, killed in a fight shortly before the troupe was to perform in Stratford in 1587. It&#x2019;s an appealing story&#x2014;something, after all, must have brought him from Stratford to London&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s no evidence to substantiate it, nor is there any that would confirm that Shakespeare briefly acted with or wrote for this veteran company. But what is certain from the evidence of his later work is that he was deeply familiar with their repertory.<br> <br>Scholars can identify with confidence fewer than a dozen plays, mostly histories, performed by the Queen&#x2019;s Men during their twenty-year run. Several of their titles will sound familiar: The True Tragedy of Richard the Third, The Troublesome Reign of King John, and The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth. A defining feature of Shakespeare&#x2019;s art was his penchant for overhauling the plots of old plays rather than inventing his own, and no rival company provided more raw material for Shakespeare than the Queen&#x2019;s Men. He absorbed and reworked their repertory in a series of history plays from the mid to late 1590s now familiar to us as Richard the Third, King John, the two parts of Henry the Fourth, and Henry the Fifth. Shakespeare&#x2019;s attitude to the Queen&#x2019;s Men was surely ambivalent. Their plays, which likely thrilled and inspired him in his formative years as playgoer, actor, and then playwright, had stuck with him. Yet he also would have recognized that their jingoistic repertory had become increasingly out of step with the theatrical and political times.<br> <br>Shakespeare was a sharp-eyed critic of other writers&#x2019; plays and his take on the Queen&#x2019;s Men&#x2019;s repertory could be unforgiving, rendering these sturdy old plays hopelessly anachronistic. For a glimpse of this we need only recall his parody of an unforgettably bad couplet from their True Tragedy of Richard the Third: &#x201c;The screeking raven sits croaking for revenge / Whole herds of beasts come bellowing for revenge.&#x201d; These lines from the old play, whose awfulness had clearly stuck with Shakespeare, resurface years later when Hamlet, interrupting the play-within-the-play and urging on the strolling players, deliberately mangles the couplet: &#x201c;Come, &#x2018;the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge&#x2019;&#x201d; (3.2.251&#x2013;52). At best this was a double-edged tribute, reminding playgoers of the kind of old-fashioned revenge drama they once enjoyed while showing how a naturalistic revenge play such as Hamlet had supplanted the dated and over-the-top style of the Queen&#x2019;s Men.<br> <br>Six years had passed since Shakespeare had last refashioned a Queen&#x2019;s Men&#x2019;s play in Henry the Fifth, a brilliant remake of their popular The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth. If anything, the pace of change in those intervening years, especially the last three, had wildly accelerated. The Elizabethan world that had produced King Leir and in which the play had once thrived, like the playing company that had performed it, was no longer. But these years had enabled Shakespeare, as part owner of his playhouse and shareholder in his acting company, to prosper financially. When Wright began selling copies of King Leir in July of 1605 (two months usually lapsed between the time a book was registered and sold, and he had registered it in May), Shakespeare was likely away in Stratford-upon-Avon to close on a large real estate deal, so he couldn&#x2019;t have picked up a copy until his return to London.<br> <br>King Leir, like so many histories and tragedies of the 1590s, was fixated on royal succession. These plays spoke to a nation fearful of foreign rule or the outbreak of civil war after its childless queen&#x2019;s death. For a decade that stretched from Titus Andronicus and his Henry the Sixth trilogy through Richard the Third, King John, Richard the Second, the two parts of Henry the Fourth, Henry the Fifth, Julius Caesar, and Hamlet, Shakespeare displayed time and again his mastery of this genre, exploring in play after play who had the cunning, wit, legitimacy, and ambition to seize and hold power. Those concerns peaked in the opening years of the seventeenth century as the queen approached her end, but vanished after 1603, when King James VI of Scotland, who was married and had two sons and a daughter, succeeded peacefully to the throne of England. There would be no Spanish invasion and no return to the kind of civil strife that had torn the land apart in the late fifteenth century. In an unusually explicit allusion to the political moment, Shakespeare writes in Sonnet 107 shortly after James&#x2019;s accession that:<br> <br>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,<br> <br>And the sad augurs mock their own presage;<br> <br>Incertainties now crown themselves assured,<br> <br>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br> <br>(Sonnet 107, 5&#x2013;8)<br> <br>The language is elliptical but the meaning clear enough: all those anxious predictions that preceded the eclipse of Elizabeth&#x2014;that &#x201c;mortal moon&#x201d;&#x2014;were misplaced; the crowning of the new king who promoted himself as a peacemaker had put an end to these &#x201c;Incertainties.&#x201d;<br> <br>But other uncertainties remained. The period leading up to and following the change in regime appeared less smooth in retrospect than Sonnet 107 would on its surface suggest, for the nation and for Shakespeare professionally. The Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men, now established at the Globe, found themselves facing stiffer competition than ever. Back in 1594 there had been only three permanent outdoor playhouses in London: the Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, and the Rose on Bankside. Since then, new theaters continued to sprout around the City, competing for the pennies and shillings of London&#x2019;s playgoers. Spectators were now flocking to see the Admiral&#x2019;s Men at the Fortune Theatre (to the northwest, in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate), as well as to see Worcester&#x2019;s Men perform at the Boar&#x2019;s Head Inn (in Whitechapel), and to playhouses at St. Paul&#x2019;s and Blackfriars, smaller indoor sites where boy companies performed plays by London&#x2019;s edgier young dramatists. Aging public playhouses&#x2014;the Curtain and the Swan in Southwark near Paris Garden Stairs&#x2014;also peeled away customers.<br> <br>Other and unexpected threats to the prosperity of Shakespeare and his fellow shareholders soon emerged. In early 1603, their influential patron, the Lord Chamberlain George Carey (second cousin to Queen Elizabeth), became seriously ill. More bad news followed. First came a Privy Council announcement on March 19, 1603, that because of concerns about civil unrest as Elizabeth lay dying, all public performances were canceled &#x201c;till other direction be given.&#x201d; News the following week of the queen&#x2019;s death and the declaration that the King of Scots was now King of England as well, while reassuring the English that regime change would not be bloody, also meant that during this mourning period the playhouses were unlikely to open anytime soon. London&#x2019;s playing companies must have been rocked by the next piece of disturbing news, as they waited to see how supportive of the theater King James would be. One of James&#x2019;s first royal proclamations, on May 7, 1603, was to ban performances on the Sabbath. It was a punishing decree that cut into theatrical profits, for Sunday was the only day of the week that most playgoers weren&#x2019;t laboring at work. Was this merely a sop to theater-hating Puritans or was it a sign that the new king saw little value in public theater?<br> <br>The drumbeat of setbacks for Shakespeare and his company continued. King James didn&#x2019;t wait for the ailing George Carey to die before replacing him as Lord Chamberlain. This meant that Shakespeare was no longer a Chamberlain&#x2019;s Man, merely the servant of the disempowered Carey (who passed away in early September). The theater companies were facing their own succession struggle, one that would have to be resolved in the wake of the national one. At stake were royal patronage and the chance to be favored at court. It could not have been reassuring that the Earl of Nottingham, patron of their longtime rivals the Admiral&#x2019;s Men, had secured a place in the new monarch&#x2019;s inner circle.<br> <br>Other unexpected and nagging threats emerged as the change in government encouraged those who wanted a share of the lucrative business of staging plays. Richard Fiennes, an aristocrat badly in need of money, proposed that in exchange for an annual payment of forty pounds he be awarded a patent allowing him to collect a poll tax of &#x201c;a penny a head on all the playgoers in England.&#x201d; Fiennes argued that since playgoing was a voluntary activity (much like what the king himself had deemed the &#x201c;vile custom of tobacco taking&#x201d;), it could be regulated and taxed by the state, and he would be happy to pay for overseeing that activity in exchange for a hefty cut of box office receipts. Since admission to the public playhouses started at a penny, Fiennes&#x2019;s proposal was outrageously greedy. Luckily for London&#x2019;s actors, nothing came of this nor of another proposal not long after from the other end of the social ladder, by a disabled veteran of the Irish wars, Francis Clayton. Fiennes had hoped to obtain a royal patent to tax playgoers; Clayton appealed to Parliament to tax performances, seeking for himself a &#x201c;small allowance of two shillings out of every stage play that shall be acted . . . to be paid unto me or my assigns during my life by the owners and actors of those plays and shows.&#x201d; It must have struck the players as absurd: anyone with a scheme and some political connections could submit a plan to cut into their hard-earned profits. Fiennes&#x2019;s and Clayton&#x2019;s proposals&#x2014;although they went nowhere&#x2014;were one more headache for Shakespeare and his fellows, vulnerable at this time of transition and of freewheeling and often unpredictable political largess.<br> <br>Then, suddenly, came news that profoundly altered the trajectory of Shakespeare&#x2019;s career: King James chose Shakespeare and his fellow players as his official company. After May 19, 1603, Shakespeare and eight others were to be known as the King&#x2019;s Men, authorized to perform not only at the court and the Globe but also throughout the realm, if they wished to tour. It was more than a symbolic title; Shakespeare was now a Groom of the Chamber, and he and the other shareholders were each issued four and a half yards of red cloth for royal livery to be worn on state occasions.<br> <br>Exactly how and why Shakespeare&#x2019;s company was elevated to the position of King&#x2019;s Men has never been satisfyingly explained. Their talent and reputation surely played a part. So too did a little-known English actor named Laurence Fletcher. Fletcher had spent time acting in Scotland, where King James had come to know and like him. This relationship accounts for why Fletcher&#x2019;s name appears first, right before Shakespeare&#x2019;s, in the list of those designated as the King&#x2019;s Men, though he had never been affiliated with the company before this. Fletcher was merely a player; though a valuable go-between, he could not, by himself, have been responsible for Shakespeare&#x2019;s company&#x2019;s swift promotion. More powerful brokers were undoubtedly involved. One of them might have been the younger brother of their dying patron, Sir Robert Carey, who had ridden posthaste from London to Edinburgh to bring James word of Elizabeth&#x2019;s death. Others might have been Shakespeare&#x2019;s former patron, the Earl of Southampton, newly released from the Tower, or perhaps the Earl of Pembroke, an admirer of Richard Burbage and a patron of poets and artists. Mystery will always surround how Shakespeare and his fellow players were chosen to be the King&#x2019;s Men. What matters is that it happened and that they had won their own succession struggle&#x2014;and the plays that Shakespeare would subsequently write would be powerfully marked by this turn of events.<br> <br>The King&#x2019;s Men did not have much of a chance to celebrate their good fortune, for London was soon struck by a devastating outbreak of ...</p><h2>Fire in the Belly: On Being a Man</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Sam Keen is one of the most creative, profound thinkers of our time.

I didn&#x2019;t drink, smoke, or swear. I was the only one in P. S. duPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, who wore cowboy boots. I did not shave, had only a sparse crop of pubic hair, and was embarrassed in the locker room. I never got a letter in a major sport. To this day I avoid anyone who was in my high school class, especially old football heroes. I hated fraternities. The only thing that saved me from being a complete geek was that I had a car and a girlfriend, although the car was only a Model A Ford and the girlfriend was not a cheerleader.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today I look at an old picture of that seventeen-year-old boy. He is dressed for the senior prom in a rented white dinner jacket&#x2014;lanky, loose-jointed, too-large hands on hips, the pose clearly adopted from Gary Cooper. Next to him stands his girlfriend, Janet, already looking mature, dressed in the traditional white gown with the traditional purple orchid, filled with the traditional dreams of settling down. They are both virgins. I see hints in his ungainly adolescent body of the man he will become. In the forward-leaning head, slightly sunken chest, and forward-curved shoulders is the form of a question mark. In the awkwardness of his pose I see him trying to be suave for the occasion and play the man while he still feels himself to be a boy. I know he will feel boyish, not a man among men, well into his mature years.<br> &nbsp;<br> But it is his face that moves me most. Open. Shining. Filled with a strange power of innocence and strong dreams. His mask of sophistication hides the painful sensitivity he fears is a mark of his inadequacy as a man. I do not see, but remember well, the loneliness, the uncertainty, the feeling of being both proud and embarrassed by the secret life the boy was living.<br> &nbsp;<br> His clandestine life included many activities not on any list of requirements for being a real man: keeping a diary; exploring nearby woods and longing for the wilderness; sleeping under the stars; taking long walks alone; waiting and watching to see what would happen when a cowbird laid its eggs in a vireo&#x2019;s nest; masturbating and imagining the woman of his dreams; wondering about the limits of his mind; exploring his dark moods; writing poetry; reading books and playing with ideas; loving his parents; agonizing about war, poverty, injustice, torture; wanting to do something to make the world better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today I honor the boy, knowing that he knew far more about manhood than he thought he knew. For instance, the week after the prom, he set out on his walkabout, a trip across the U.S., working on a wheat harvest, ranches, carnivals, etc. Hidden in his young heart was a craving to discover his own definition of manhood. Father to the man who is writing this book, he did not know it but he had already set out on a pilgrimage, a quest to find the Grail.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deep down, the tectonic plates that have supported the modern world are shifting. Revolutions are daily occurrences; the centers of power are moving. Ancient enemies are making common cause. Paradigms and worldviews are changing overnight. Yesterday&#x2019;s certainties are today&#x2019;s superstitions. Today is all chaos and creativity. As the sign down at the local Chevron station says: &#x201c;If you aren&#x2019;t harried, worried, and a little bit nuts you don&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s going on around here.&#x201d; Nobody can predict the shape of tomorrow&#x2019;s world.<br> &nbsp;<br> The earthquake that is shaking men and women, their roles and interrelationships, is part and parcel of this shifting of the world culture&#x2019;s tectonic plates. The changes in our gender roles are only one aspect of the upheaval that accompanies the death of one epoch and the birth of another. And we will be in the birth process for several generations.<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of what feminists rightly call Western his-story men were considered the norm for humanity, the standard by which sanity and virtue were judged, and women were considered mysterious, suspect, and slightly deviant. Freud articulated the standard opinion when he asked with supposed seriousness, &#x201c;What does a woman want?&#x201d; Until recently, women were characterized as the gender with the problem. But nearly a generation ago, women began to lead the revolution in gender. Feminist philosophers, theologians, poets, and social activists have gone a long way toward articulating a systematic critique of modern society, redefining female identity, and securing equal rights. They have made it abundantly clear that the answer to Freud&#x2019;s question is, and has always been, obvious to men of goodwill. First and foremost, women want what they have been denied&#x2014;justice, equality, respect, and power.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today the question that is the yeast in the social dough is: What do men want? The traditional notions of manhood are under attack and men are being called upon to defend themselves, to change, to become something other than what they have been. The matter was summarized in a recent Newsweek article on &#x201c;Guns and Dolls&#x201d;1:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps the time has come for a new agenda. Women, after all, are not a big problem. Our society does not suffer from burdensome amounts of empathy and altruism, or a plague of nurturance. The problem is men&#x2014;or more accurately, maleness.... Men are killing themselves doing all the things that our society wants them to do. At every age they&#x2019;re dying in accidents, they&#x2019;re being shot, they drive cars badly, they ride the tops of elevators, they&#x2019;re two-fisted drinkers. And violence against women is incredibly pervasive. Maybe it&#x2019;s men&#x2019;s raging hormones, [or] ... because they&#x2019;re trying to be a man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ask most any man, &#x201c;How does it feel to be a man these days? Do you feel manhood is honored, respected, celebrated?&#x201d; Those who pause long enough to consider their gut feelings will likely tell you they feel blamed, demeaned, and attacked. But their reactions may be pretty vague. Many men feel as if they are involved in a night battle in a jungle against an unseen foe. Voices from the surrounding darkness shout hostile challenges: &#x201c;Men are too aggressive. Too soft. Too insensitive. Too macho. Too power-mad. Too much like little boys. Too wimpy. Too violent. Too obsessed with sex. Too detached to care. Too busy. Too rational. Too lost to lead. Too dead to feel.&#x201d; Exactly what we are supposed to become is not clear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Men have only recently begun to explore new visions and definitions of manhood. At no time in recent history have there been so many restless, questioning men. Granted, this yeasty brotherhood is still a minority, but it is a powerful ferment. As yet, there is little literature that speaks to these questing men. The most spiritually adventurous men of our time have moved out on the frontier beyond the reporters, the popularizers, the psychologists, the so-called &#x201c;experts&#x201d; about men. Go into a good bookstore and ask if they have a section on women&#x2019;s studies and you will be shown a rich variety of books on social theory, linguistics, biographies of forgotten heroines, women&#x2019;s poetry, studies of the goddess, histories of feminism, etc. Ask if they have a men&#x2019;s studies section and you will be shown a small one with titles relating to (1) gay experience; (2) diatribes about men&#x2019;s inadequacies and failures (Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them, What to Do When He Won&#x2019;t Change, The Peter Pan Syndrome,2 etc., ad nauseam); or (3) something called &#x201c;men&#x2019;s liberation,&#x201d; which sounds suspiciously like warmed-over feminism with a reverse twist. Not much here to stir the head, the heart, or the gonads.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is an attempt to fill this lack. It is not One-Minute Masculinity or simple answers for simple men. It is for a new kind of man who is being forged in the crucible of the chaos of our time. It is for men who are willing to undertake a spiritual journey beginning with the disillusioning awareness that what we have agreed to call &#x201c;normal&#x201d; is a facade covering a great deal of alienation. But it goes beyond the valley of the shadow to celebrate a new vision of manhood&#x2014;a vision of man with fire in his belly and passion in his heart. The path it follows is the ancient way of the hero&#x2019;s journey that involves departure from everyday normality; descent into the strange land of dis-ease, demons, dreadful powers, treasures, and maidens guarded by dragons; and, finally, a return home to the heart of the ordinary.<br> &nbsp;<br> I structured the book along the lines of something Paul Tillich, perhaps the greatest philosopher-theologian of our time, was fond of saying. &#x201c;Every serious thinker,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;must ask and answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is wrong with us? With men? Women? Society? What is the nature of our alienation? Our dis-ease? (2) What would we be like if we were whole? Healed? Actualized? If our potentiality was fulfilled? (3) How do we move from our condition of brokenness to wholeness? What are the means of healing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions</h2><p><p><strong>From the land of the rising sun, strangely practical and utterly eccentric inventions for a life of ease&#x2015;and hilarity.</strong></p><p>In Japan, Kenji Kawakami is famous for his tireless promotion of Chindogu: the art of the unuseless idea.

As Luz departs Milwaukee in a ramshackle old VW Bug, she finds her heart opened by a series of seemingly random encounters with remarkable women. In San Antonio, however, a startling revelation awaits: a reunion with a woman from her past.

When Luz is a grown woman, Abuela insists on making a trip to her home village, Angangueo, in Mexico, where the monarch butterflies migrate each year, but Luz is reluctant to interrupt her life. Abuela dies before they can make the trip, and Luz, tormented by regrets, decides to make the journey with Abuela's ashes, driving from Milwaukee to Mexico, following the path of the butterflies. Along the way, Luz meets extraordinary women who transform her: a tough but gentle young girl scarred by life; a free-spirited wanderer; a prim and proper woman who has lost opportunities. Arriving in San Antonio, Tex., to find her aunt, Luz meets her mother, who she had always believed dead. Now Luz must face her mother's reappearance in her life and get her grandmother's ashes to Mexico for the Day of the Dead. Monroe (Time Is a River) has succeeded, in her third novel, in taking a straightforward coming-of-age story and adding a Mexican twist to it, but the characters are stock and the outcome predictable, though readers who take comfort in knowing what comes next will not be disappointed.

What, after all, is authentic human sexuality? That is the question Judith and Jack Balswick set out to answer in this wide-ranging and probing book. Informed by sociology, psychology, and theology, the Balswicks investigate how human sexuality originates both biologically and socially. They lay groundwork for a normative Christian interpretation of sexuality, show how authentic sexuality is necessarily grounded in relationships, and explore such forms of "inauthentic sexuality" as sexual harassment, pornography, and rape. Since its first publication, <em>Authentic Human Sexuality</em> has established itself as a standard text at numerous colleges and seminaries. Now this third edition features updated theological and social science research, insights from current neuropsychological evidence, and an expanded biblical model of authentic sexual relationships, along with updated discussion of sexual minorities, same-sex attraction, and LGBTQ issues. A new generation of students, pastors, psychologists, and sociologists engaged in counseling will be indebted to the Balswicks for this study of an endlessly fascinating and perplexing facet of human identity.</p><p>Judith K.

Seminary educators at the forefront of marriage and family research, Jack Balswick and Judy Balswick bring decades of social science and biblical wisdom to their analysis of today's sexual norms. Exploring a wide range of contemporary issues&#x2015;including sexual orientation and gay marriage, singlehood, cohabitation, marriage, and divorce&#x2015;the Balswicks evaluate each according to its impact on human flourishing, especially concerning children. Their content on sexual harassment, porn, and abuse is indispensable. Significantly, <em>Authentic Human Sexuality</em> also offers a robust critique of male dominance and its affront to human flourishing and authentic human sexuality. Whether pastors, students, or just life-long learners, readers will value this careful review of the ethical and spiritual issues Christians face in discerning the meaning of authentic human sexuality and how it shapes our communities."

This delicious romp by the author of <i>The Ballad of Valentine</i> and the illustrator who created <i>Skippyjon Jones</i> would make a unique and unforgettable hostess gift.</p><p>In the awfully silly <i>I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Pie</i>, children's librarian and author Alison Jackson bypasses pilgrims completely and cuts straight to the stomach of Thanksgiving in America--dinner. A slightly dizzying new spin on the well-loved cumulative rhyming song "I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly," this madcap picture book stars a ravenously hungry relative who comes to Thanksgiving dinner with a pie. Since she eats the pie in its entirety before she even gets in the house, she has to swallow some cider (that "rumbled and mumbled and grumbled inside her"). If you must know, "She swallowed the cider to moisten the pie, / The Thanksgiving pie, which was really too dry, /Perhaps she'll die." The story continues in this vein, as we watch the hosts grow visibly alarmed--and the children visibly delighted-- by the old lady's surreal appetite and supernaturally increasing girth. Illustrator Judith Byron Schachner--creator of the acclaimed <i>Willy and May</i>--has masterfully captured this ludicrous tale in hilariously haywire pen-and-ink drawings, splashed with watercolor. Kids will love this romping, rhyming frolic through a familiar favorite. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>Alison Jackson is the award-winning artist who created the BBC TV series <b>Double Take </b>and the internationally acclaimed Schweppes advertising campaign.

Brooks's beloved series. From 1927 to 1958, Brooks wrote 26 Freddy books--including <i>Freddy Goes to Florida</i>--all focused on the well-rounded pig, who has been described by various fans as ingenious, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. Since Brooks's books fell out of print, librarians across the country have scrounged up copies wherever possible, even resorting to photocopying the books and binding them with hockey-stick tape! To the delight of thousands, the fabulous Freddy books have been reprinted by Overlook Press!<p> The intrigue of <i>Freddy the Detective</i> begins on the Bean Farm (Freddy's upstate New York abode), when a toy train is discovered missing from young Everett Bean's room. Freddy jumps at the chance to prove his sleuth skills: "I'll find that train, you bet! There are a lot of mysteries on a farm like this and I'll solve 'em all!" he proclaims. The pig can't gracefully outfox the rats (and they sing derisive songs about him), but eventually he does solve cases from "The Mystery of Egbert" (about a bunny who'd wandered off from his family) to "The Case of Prinny's Dinner" (about a white woolly dog's missing food). The shenanigans all sound innocent enough, but Brooks is hilariously tongue-in-cheek; his insightful descriptions of animal characters are always compassionate; and his subtle appeal to a child's instinct for justice is no less than masterful. As Adam Hochschild of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> writes, "The moral center of my childhood universe, the place where good and evil, friendship and treachery, honesty and humbug were defined most clearly, was not church, not school, and not the Boy Scouts. It was the Bean Farm." Welcome back, Freddy! (Ages 9 to 12, but great for reading aloud to younger children.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><p><strong>Walter R. Brooks</strong>&nbsp;was born in Rome, New York on January 9, 1886, and died in Roxbury, New York on August 17, 1958. Brooks attended the University of Rochester and, after graduation, worked for the American Red Cross and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

The simple plot revolves around a young girl who is sent to the principal's office when she can't stop speaking in hyphenated slang words; e.g., higgledy-piggledy, mish-mash, nit-wit, etc. As it turns out, her teacher, the school nurse, and the principal seem to come down with the same affliction and, before finding a solution, run through a veritable compendium of hyphenated words and nonsense phrases, most of which rhyme. Those reading aloud should prepare themselves for the inevitable outpouring of similar words from the audience.

While his paintings were widely known in his day, only a few friends and associates had any intimation of the extent of his medical research. Leonardo's "Anatomical Manuscript A," created over the winter of 1510-11, is the only group of such drawings in which he approached complete coverage of the human form, and it represents his finest work in this area. <br> This fascinating book presents a complete discussion of all the drawings in Manuscript A, not only as evidence of Leonardo's artistic genius, but also as the product of the sophisticated scientific investigations they represent. Each drawing records a meticulous human dissection and is extensively annotated with Leonardo's notes, questions, and memoranda to himself in "mirror-writing," (backward writing legible only when held up to a mirror, the motivations for which have been the subject of much speculation). <br> Each drawing is reproduced twice: once in its original form and once with a new English translation in place of Leonardo's original notes. The authors comment on the accuracy of the anatomical renderings and the conclusions Leonardo draws from them.</p><p><br> Martin Clayton is a deputy curator of the Print Room, Windsor Castle, and is a well-known authority on the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci. He is the author of Leonardo da Vinci: A Curious Vision (Merrell Publishers, 1996) and Leonardo da Vinci: The Divine and the Grotesque (Royal Collections Enterprises Ltd, 2002). Ronald Philo is an anatomy expert and a senior lecturer at the University of Texas in San Antonio.

Lang, a member of the London Oratory, studies the direction of liturgical prayer from an historical, theological, and pastoral point of view. At a propitious moment, this book resumes a debate that, despite appearances to the contrary, has never really gone away, not even after the Second Vatican Council. Historical research has made the controversy less partisan, and among the faithful there is an increasing sense of the problems inherent in an arrangement that hardly shows the liturgy to be open to the things that are above and to the world to come.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this situation, Lang&#x2019;s delightfully objective and wholly unpolemical book is a valuable guide. Without claiming to offer major new insights, Lang carefully presents the results of recent research and provides the material necessary for making an informed judgment.

But for the first time since Carl Jung's work, comes bold new research that explains scientifically how we can identify, understand, and perhaps even control the frequency of coincidences in our everyday lives. <br> <br>Bernard Beitman, a leading expert on Coincidence Studies, proposes a greater personal responsibility which depends partly upon newly discovered "grid cells" located in the brain, near the hippocampus. But neuroscience cannot complete the entire puzzle, and in this fascinating guide, Beitman provides the missing piece. From analyzing true stories of synchronicity from around the globe and throughout history, he shares key personality characteristics and situational factors that contribute to the occurrence of meaningful coincidences in our lives.

He is a Visiting Professor at the University of Virginia and former Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Missouri-Columbia. He attended Yale Medical School and completed a psychiatric residency at Stanford. Dr. Beitman has received two national awards for his psychotherapy training program and is internationally known for his research into the relationship between chest pain and panic disorder. In addition, he has edited two issues of <i>Psychiatric Annals</i> that focus on coincidences. Dr. Beitman is the founder of Coincidence Studies. His work with coincidences was the subject of a feature story in Men's Health.<p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>At some point in our lives, all of us have experienced a fleeting moment when a weird coincidence made us smile and wonder. It could have been a song that came on the radio just as it went through your mind or a phone call from a long-lost friend the very day you thought of this person. Or, it could appear as it did for Saundra&#x2015;in black and white letters. Saundra was enjoying Chinese food at her father's house and texted her sister to let her know that one of their favorite movies, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, was on television. Her sister texted back that she remembered watching the movie with their mother, who was now deceased. 'Mom would always fix popcorn . . .' she typed as she fondly remembered their treasured times together.</p> <p>While Saundra was reading her sister's text message, she grabbed a fortune cookie and opened it. Much to her delight, her fortune greeted her with the word popcorn.</p> <p>Something special had just happened to Saundra, and when she texted her sister to tell her, they both felt the presence and comfort of their mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>I've been deeply interested in coincidences like this most of my life&#x2015;trying to make sense of them, to understand how best to use them, and how best to explain them to skeptics and believers alike.</p> <p>I had experienced coincidences many times before, but none was more startling than what happened at 11:00 PM on February 26, 1973, when I was thirty-one years old. Suddenly, I found myself bent over the kitchen sink in an old Victorian house on Hayes Street in the Fillmore District of San Francisco. I was choking on something caught in my throat. I couldn't cough it up. I hadn't eaten anything. I didn't know what was in my throat. I'd never choked for this long before. Finally, after fifteen minutes or so, I could swallow and breathe normally.</p> <p>The next day, my birthday, my brother called to tell me that our father had died in Wilmington, Delaware, at 2:00 AM Eastern Standard Time. He was three thousand miles and three time zones away; 2:00 AM in Wilmington was 11:00 PM in California. My father had bled into his throat and choked on his own blood at about the same time I was uncontrollably choking. He died on February 27, my birthday.</p> <p>Was this just a coincidence? No. The timing was too perfect. The experience was too visceral. I loved my father, but I had no idea that our connection could transcend time and space in this way. I began to wonder if other people had had similar experiences.</p> <p>A man riding a train back to his home in Zurich, Switzerland, was suddenly overtaken by a frightening vision of someone drowning. Upon arriving home, he discovered that his grandson had almost drowned in the lake by his house around the time of the terrifying vision.</p> <p>The man in this story was psychiatrist Carl Jung, who invented the word <i>synchronicity</i> for a wide spectrum of weird coincidences. He personally experienced many strange events, but his writings focused more on theoretical speculation. Known as the preeminent theoretician of coincidence, he developed the synchronicity theory using complex ideas from quantum physics and ancient philosophies, along with his own concepts of the collective unconscious and archetypes. He also clearly documented that meaningful coincidences have been recognized throughout human history in many different cultures. I've explored much the same forest as Jung but followed a different path.</p> <p>I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, the headquarters of the DuPont Company, where chemistry was king. During some school assemblies, we watched movies depicting the history of this onetime gunpowder company, which started on the banks of the Brandywine River that runs through Wilmington. I liked chemistry and majored in chemistry at Swarthmore College. If I'd continued on in this major, I would've been faced with a choice of becoming either a chemist or a chemical engineer. The chemist comes up with new ideas and molecules. The chemical engineer figures out how to use them. I chose the practical path, but not in that discipline. I became a psychiatrist, a profession in which chemicals are often used to help people.</p> <p>As one whose profession revolves around the life of the mind, I also began to notice the weird coincidences in my life, as well as those in the lives of my patients. My fascination with the subject eventually led me to conduct research on coincidence at the University of Missouri-Columbia, the results of which appeared in two issues of the journal <i>Psychiatric Annals</i>, for which I was the editor.<b>1</b> Now the engineer in me is using the results of that research to put coincidence to practical use. I see myself as an engineer for Jung's theoretical ideas.</p> <p>As demonstrated by my research at the University of Missouri-Columbia, at least a third of the general population frequently notices weird coincidences. Friends, colleagues, patients, acquaintances, and strangers standing in line at a coffee shop&#x2015;many people seem to be talking about, if not experiencing, coincidences these days. 'What a coincidence!' 'What are the chances of that happening?' 'Let me tell you about this coincidence.' In our modern technological culture, there are even smartphone apps to help you track your coincidences.</p> <p>But what do people mean by 'coincidence'?</p> <p>For some people, coincidences represent random chance at work. To these rationalists, the universe runs like a clock, and the laws of probability describe how the Grand Machine runs. They are 'just' or 'mere' or 'only' coincidences. Others believe that meaningful coincidences are the work of a personal God who is guiding and nurturing them. In between God and probability lies a broad spectrum of theories. The emerging field of coincidence studies, a field I'm helping to develop, proposes closer connections between mind and environment than are currently accepted in psychiatry and psychology.</p> <p>Our perceptions of coincidence emerge from swirls of information in our minds juxtaposed with swirls of events in our surroundings. Like two dials being spun by separate hands, the active mind and a pattern of events briefly coincide, causing the mind to note an odd correspondence. The match is often surprising because it seems improbable. But coincidence is more than the unlikely juxtaposition of similar events&#x2015;the two events must also be meaningfully connected, and the meaning is personal and intricately linked to the person involved.</p> <p>Many books offer compilations of amazing coincidence stories, and there is no shortage of books advocating specific theories. This book is different. I've tried to pull apart the coincidence reports from many different sources to see how and why they could've happened the way they did. In the process of examining these stories, I've come to discover the essential features that make coincidences happen, including the personality characteristics and situational factors that serve to increase their frequency. These characteristics and factors have proven to be so consistent that I realized we actually do&#x2015;and can&#x2015;make our own coincidences.</p> <p>Part 1 shows how meaningful coincidences occur in all aspects of life: relationships, health, money, and spirit. It introduces several possible uses and explanations. Part 2 outlines concrete suggestions about how to use coincidences, particularly 'instrumental' coincidences. These coincidences provide practical assistance in daily life in two different ways. The first kind delivers just what is needed&#x2015;a person, information, or money. The second kind provides a comment about a question or a decision. Part 2 also describes how to increase the frequency of coincidences. Part 3 introduces the psychosphere, our mental atmosphere. Just as we exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere, we exchange subtle forms of energy and information with the psychosphere. These subtle exchanges of energy-information may form the basis for many otherwise unexplainable coincidences, including my simultaneous choking while my father was dying.</p> <p><b>1</b> <i>Psychiatric Annals, </i>Vol. 39, Issue 5, May 2009, and <i>Psychiatric Annals, </i>Vol. 41, Issue 12, December 2011.</p> <p>�2016 Bernard D.

Theories of myth may differ on the answers they give to any of these questions, but more basically they may also differ on which of the questions they ask. C. G. Jung's theory is one of the few that purports to answer fully all three questions. This volume collects and organizes the key passages on myth by Jung himself and by some of the most prominent Jungian writers after him: Erich Neumann, Marie-Louise von Franz, and James Hillman. The book synthesizes the discovery of myth as a way of thinking, where it becomes a therapeutic tool providing an entrance to the unconscious.</p><br><p> In the first selections, Jung begins to differentiate his theory from Freud's by asserting that there are fantasies and dreams of an "impersonal" nature that cannot be reduced to experiences in a person's past. Jung then asserts that the similarities among myths are the result of the projection of the collective rather than the personal unconscious onto the external world. Finally, he comes to the conclusion that myth originates and functions to satisfy the psychological need for contact with the unconscious--not merely to announce the <i>existence</i> of the unconscious, but to let us <i>experience </i>it.</p></p><p><b>Robert A.

Le Guin.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> This thoughtfully curated and richly illustrated collection celebrates oratory old and new, highlighting speeches we know and admire, while also shining a light on profound drafts that were never delivered or have until now been forgotten. From George Bernard Shaw's warm and rousing toast to Albert Einstein in 1930 and the commencement address affectionately given to graduates at Long Island University by Kermit the Frog, to the chilling public announcement (that was thankfully never made) by President Richard Nixon should Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become stranded on the moon, <i>Speeches of Note</i> honors the words and ideas of some of history&#x2019;s most provocative and inspiring personages.</p><p>SHAUN USHER is a writer, the custodian of the hugely popular blog <i>Letters of Note</i>, and the author of <i>Letters of Note</i> and <i>Lists of Note</i>. Visit speechesofnote.com.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>Speeches hold enormous power. They can start deadly wars or even bring them to a close. They can expose truths long hidden. They can impart advice so profound as to alter lives. They can celebrate the legacies of those departed. They can persuade a nation to change course. A perfectly pitched speech, delivered at the right time, can bring together people from the most disparate of&nbsp;backgrounds and, if only for the duration of the speech itself, unite them. <br><br>In this modern age, as hyper-connected as we are and with technology in our pockets that enables us to record and broadcast at the press of a button, speeches can find audiences reaching the millions when once they might have been heard only by a few. Footage of these speeches is being shared online at lightning pace, racing through vast, globe-spanning networks of like-minded people and achieving a potency and impact that not long ago would have been impossible. <br><br>This book is a celebration of all of this human emotion captured in oratory old and new. The speeches here are windows through which you are able to step into someone&#x2019;s shoes and imagine standing in front of an audience, as these people once did with hearts in their mouths, adrenaline coursing through their veins, countless eyes&nbsp;upon them, unsure whether the words they were soon to speak would be received as they hoped, whether the risk would pay off, whether their message would result in lives changed, affirmed, or even ended. <br><br>In compiling this collection I have resisted the urge to merely cover the speeches we all know so well, so while you will indeed find oratory by the greats in these pages, you will also be introduced to some lesser-known speeches previously ignored through no fault of their own: George Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s warm and rousing toast to Albert Einstein, a man &#x201c;challenging the axioms of science&#x201d;; the commencement address affectionately given to graduates at Long Island University by Kermit the Frog; Tilda Swinton&#x2019;s homage to friend and &#x201c;fellow freak&#x201d; David Bowie, intimately delivered despite his absence, three years before his death; Nick Cave&#x2019;s marvelous lecture on his relationship with the love song; and many more. <br><br>Other speeches here are engrossing because they were never delivered and to this day remain unspoken, as with the chilling draft scripted for Queen Elizabeth II in 1983 by officials imagining the onset of World War III, and the powerful words that Native American Wamsutta Frank B. James was stopped from delivering at a U.S. state dinner in 1970. Some speeches became notable before their reader had even taken to the podium, as evidenced by the thick script in the jacket pocket of Theodore Roosevelt that slowed the course of a would-be assassin&#x2019;s bullet to such an extent that he was able to address the crowd, as planned, wearing a blood-stained shirt.<br><br>Where possible, to further immerse you and bring you closer to the historical moment, I have tracked down and included images of the speeches themselves&nbsp;&#x2013; that is, the very document from which these people read as they made their voices heard. Some are typewritten, some composed by hand. Accompanying other addresses are photographs of the speeches being delivered; elsewhere, some gorgeous illustrations. In instances where recordings are available, they have been transcribed as accurately as possible. For those speeches where no such audio exists, I have referred to historical transcripts. <br><br>No doubt there are speeches you believe should have made it into this book&nbsp;&#x2013; indeed, there are many I am yet to discover or have recommended and I&#x2019;d love you to share your favorites with me on Twitter @SpeechesOfNote. <br><br>All told, you have in your hands a book quite unlike any other: a lusciously produced roller-coaster ride through seventy-five speeches of note, all of which are deserving of a wider audience. <br><br>Shaun Usher <br><i>Speeches of Note </i></p><h2>A Rocky Mountain Christmas</h2><p><b>THE GREATEST WESTERN WRITERS OF THE 21ST CENTURY</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>The families Jensen and MacCallister reunite in a gripping tale of tragedy, survival, love, betrayal, and maybe even a miracle . . .</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Three days before Christmas, Matt Jensen is traveling the Denver and Pacific railway when an avalanche slams down onto the train, trapping it in desolate Trout Creek Pass.

Particularly useful is the wide scope of the book, which includes not just Tibetan and other bowls and the techniques used to sound them but Chinese bells, drilbu and ding-sha, the planets, elements and chakras, cymatics, overtones and partials, nada yoga, mantras, symbolism and astrology of the bowls, their relation to western music, Pythagoras and Newton, and the psychic integrity and true awareness of the bowl user. There is almost nothing that is not here. Although in the 1970s Frank Perry was one of the earliest practitioners of Himalayan Bowls his music has also been profoundly experimental, so that there are techniques in this book not to be found elsewhere alongside the clearest and most detailed analysis of how to &#39;play&#39; the bowls, a combination which shows in Perry&#39;s bestselling albums Deep Peace and Celestial Harmonies. Not only can you sound your bowls and perform with them, you can understand their overtones and harmonics and thus appreciate the tradition from which they come and the subtle symbols and messages associated with them Frank&#39;s writing is also a revelation of his personal contact with living Himalayan Masters, his immersion in esoteric traditions and mysticism, and his understanding of other art forms such as the paintings of Nicholas Roerich, where he is an expert. He is the author many articles but this is his first book. As a musician he is widely mentioned in books on both percussion and improvisation, including those by Derek Bailey and Bettine and Taylor. He has recorded with Brian Eno and is an international performer familiar with both radio, television and modern media. Nonetheless he is in private a true ascetic, for whom the sound experience he is hearing and maybe creating is paramount. The second edition is expanded and corrected, with the addition of a chapter and a further appendix.</p><p>Frank Perry, a percussionist with an international audience before ever he discovered singing bowls, leads his field and is a master of conventional improvisation, deep meditation, psychic awareness and esoteric study. He has written on Sir Francis Bacon and lectured on Nicholas Roerich but is best known as the world&#39;s leading exponent of the meditative practice of bowls, bells and gongs. A natural psychic, he was involved with Spiritualism, Theosophy, Vedanta and before finding deep roots in the White Eagle Lodge. He has influenced musicians such as Keith Tippett, Alex Cline and Tim Wheater.&#34;My journey into the world of Singing Bowls began in 1973. But the only book that I will recommend on this subject is Himalayan Sound Revelations by Frank Perry&#34; Mitch Nur &#34;Frank Perry&#39;s Himalayan Sound Revelations is a masterpiece of writing about the nature and power of pure sound as encoded into the consciously constructed instruments of the East. No other book in the field of working with sound for healing and spiritual development is as knowledgable, penetrating and comprehensive as this great tome. Contained within these pages is far, far more than an exploration of every aspect of singing bowls, instruments that Perry literally knows inside out through his enormous collection and varied use over many years of practice. Each chapter is an in-depth study of what the bowls have to offer in relation to ancient symbolism, yin/yang shapes, astrology, chakras, mantra, nada yoga, overtones. cymatics (wave fields), planets and musical temperament. Along the way we are given much knowledge of these topics in and of themselves - for example, the use of the voice. The book balances perfectly the historical, theoretical, spiritual and practical sides of these profound instruments and their metals. Very helpful in absorbing Perry&#39;s wisdom are the many illustrations, photographs, tables and diagrams. What especially sets it apart is how Perry places them into a spiritual, historical context such as no other text has done and thus makes the bowls (and bells) living, breathing entities. The tome is scholarly but not in an academic sense. It is simply thorough and the writing is clear, direct and substantial without unnecessary digressions. Thus Himalayan Sound Revelations will appeal both to those who wish to make practical use of singing bowls (choosing them, playing them properly and even caring for them) and those who would like to understand the historical context of the bowls and their role in healing and spirituality. Himalayan Sound Revelations is truly a universal work of a music master. It is bound to become a classic and belongs on the shelf of every serious student of Eastern music, meditation and spirituality.&#34; James D&#39;Angelo, author of The Healing Power of the Human Voice and Seed Sounds for Tuning the Chakras &#34;This book is without doubt the seminal book on these mystical Tibetan instruments. The book offers a comprehensive contribution to the emerging scholarship on this arcane subject.&#34; Alain Presencer, pioneer of the study of singing bowls and their sounds</p><h2>Viking Britain: An Exploration</h2><p>A new narrative history of the Viking Age, interwoven with exploration of the physical remains and landscapes that the Vikings fashioned and walked: their rune-stones and ship burials, settlements and battlefields. To many, the word &#39;Viking&#39; brings to mind red scenes of rape and pillage, of marauders from beyond the sea rampaging around the British coastline in the last gloomy centuries before the Norman Conquest. It is true that Britain in the Viking Age was a turbulent, violent place. The kings and warlords who have impressed their memories on the period revel in names that fire the blood and stir the imagination: Svein Forkbeard and Edmund Ironside, Ivar the Boneless and Alfred the Great, Erik Bloodaxe and Edgar the Pacifier amongst many others. Evidence for their brutality, their dominance, their avarice and their pride is still unearthed from British soil with stunning regularity. But this is not the whole story. In Viking Britain, Thomas Williams has drawn on his experience as project curator of the British Museum exhibition of Vikings: Life and Legend to show how the people we call Vikings came not just to raid and plunder, but to settle, to colonize and to rule. The impact on these islands was profound and enduring, shaping British social, cultural and political development for hundreds of years. Indeed, in language, literature, place-names and folklore, the presence of Scandinavian settlers can still be felt, and their memory - filtered and refashioned through the writings of people like J.R.R. Tolkien, William Morris and G.K.Chesterton - has transformed the western imagination. This remarkable book makes use of new academic research and first-hand experience, drawing deeply from the relics and landscapes that the Vikings and their contemporaries fashioned and walked: their runestones and ship burials, settlements and battlefields, poems and chronicles. The book offers a vital evocation of a forgotten world, its echoes in later history and its implications for the present.</p><p>Thomas Williams was a curator of the major international exhibition Vikings: Life and Legend in 2014 and is now Curator of Early Medieval Coins at the British Museum.

It first discusses the principles of A Course in Miracles, specifically focusing on the dynamics of the ego and the meaning of forgiveness. Next, the teachings of Christianity are presented in the light of these principles, with the person of Jesus also discussed in depth. Throughout, special attention is given to the application of the Course&#39;s principles to important areas in our lives such as injustice, anger, sickness, sexuality, and money.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He has written more than 25 books on the Course, including Love Does Not Condemn, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; The Message of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and many others. He has also produced over 150 audio and video titles discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder, with his wife Gloria, of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula, California.From pages 318-320 Our Gift to Jesus <p>As we learn Jesus' lesson of forgiveness, love, and unity, he asks us to teach it to the world. He asks us now to bring it to others who "hear and hear again, but do not understand; see and see again, but do not perceive" (Is 6:9). He sends us out into the darkness of the world, not to preach the light, but to be the light. He exemplifies for us the perfect unity of his message with his life, the unity he wants us to exemplify as he did. </p><p>To speak his words of forgiveness without this same forgiveness expressed in our hearts would be to teach both forgiveness and unforgiveness as one; this conflict would then become our teaching message, and the one we would be learning as well. As the Course repeatedly emphasizes: as we teach so shall we learn. Jesus is there to teach his lesson to us in all the opportunities that our egos have provided. Joining us in them, he teaches us how to look at all things as instruments of forgiveness, "healing...[our] perception of separation" (T-3.V.9:1). </p><p>There is perhaps one last gift he would ask from us, though not for himself. This is the gift of gratitude. Our gratitude to Jesus is the expression of our gratitude to God for the gifts He has given us. It is born of the awareness that our Father has never left us, though in our deluded minds we believe we have left Him. The awareness of Jesus' presence and our gratitude for it, therefore, become another "way in which He [God] is remembered, for love cannot be far behind a grateful heart and thankful mind" (M-23.4:6). </p><p>Jesus led the way back to God. How could we not be grateful to him? He has asked from us only the gifts he wishes to bring to us. Our gratitude to him is the acceptance of these gifts of love. In Jesus we find the shining picture of Who we truly are, the Christ Whom God created one with Him. In Jesus we find not only the goal, but the loving hand that reaches back to lift us up to it. Our gratitude to him is reflected in our clasping his hand as his clasps ours, saying "Yes" to his plea on our behalf. In his clear and radiant eyes, we see the innocence our Father knows to be the light of all His children; and we give thanks we have not been left to wander uncertainly in a world dark with fear. In the midst of this ego hell, we hear Jesus call to us: </p><p>My brothers in salvation, do not fail to hear my voice and listen to my words. I ask for nothing but your own release. There is no place for hell within a world whose loveliness can yet be so intense and so inclusive it is but a step from there to Heaven. To your tired eyes I bring a vision of a different world, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the pain and sorrow that you saw before. Yet this a vision is which you must share with everyone you see, for otherwise you will behold it not. To give this gift is how to make it yours. And God ordained, in loving kindness, that it be for you (T-31.VIII.8). </p><p>When confronted by the dark despair buried deep within our hearts, seeing no way to be free from it, who would not be overwhelmed with gratitude to feel a comforting hand on the shoulder, a presence of gentle light, a reassuring word? When learning at last this light has a name, a certain identity, who would not be filled with tears at its sound, at its very taste upon one's lips when it is spoken? Who would not, upon discovering the personal love in the midst of the light, leave all darkness behind and fly to his open, welcoming arms? </p><p>Who would not, in joyous gratitude for his great gift of love and life and hope, do all he asked to bring this gift to others, so that all may share in it as one, letting the joyous "Thank You" resound in every instant salvation is offered to another and accepted in ourselves? Who would not, in all humility, love, and gratitude, stand before him with empty hands and a lifted heart, and echo the words of every prophet since Abraham: "Here I am, Lord, I've come to do your will"? From pages 330-331: </p><p>Every situation offers us this same opportunity to hear the Voice for forgiveness and truth speak to us in the very form we need to hear it, to practice forgiveness in the very way that may seem to be the most difficult. Let us identify with the Source of strength in us, not with our own weakness. In our going out to the needy, let us recognize that our own need for forgiveness is being held out to us. Let us not identify with the effect of the suffering that reflects the ego's guilt and fear, but, rather, identify with the Love that removes this cause of all pain. </p><p>Let us pray with all people -- poor and rich, oppressed and oppressor, murdered and murderer -- that we may not wander into the temptation of separation, but will allow our Father to lead us out of it. Let us pray that we may share Jesus' perception of justice by sharing his Identity in God, that we may not be tempted to exclude anyone from this Identity. Let us not fear what seems to be a failure, but embrace the faith that knows that God's justice will prevail. As our own sins are forgiven and God's justice is allowed to reign in our hearts, this justice will radiate from our innocence, blessing all people with the love that true forgiveness makes free. </p><p>Let us pray for each other that each of us may do the small part that has been assigned to us, recognizing that in this part is found the Whole. Let us pray for forgiveness to become perfect in us so that it may become perfect in the world. This is the only role we have in God's plan for salvation, and it is to be accomplished in our hearts where it will become the reality it has always been. We are to live and walk in the world of separated people, but we are to walk with the perception of wholeness that comes from our belief in our own wholeness. When we have no longer placed thoughts of sin and guilt, of punishment and triumph, of separation and pain, between ourselves and the world we love, we shall succeed in the work we are to do in Jesus' name. Then we shall know that we are not apart from the world, nor is it apart from us.</p></p><h2>Rubs: 2nd Edition: Over 150 recipes for the perfect sauces, marinades, seasonings, bastes, butters and glazes (The Art of Entertaining)</h2><p>Spice things up in the kitchen!&nbsp; Rubs has been expanded to include bastes, butters, and glazes--so you can&nbsp;season any dish to create your own signature concoction.<br><br>From dry seasonings and marinades to bastes, butters, and glazes, Rubs presents more than 150 ways to deliver maximum flavor.

I n this inspiring book, bestselling author and philosopher Andr� Comte-Sponville offers a new perspective on the question of God?s existence, acknowledging the good that has come of religion while advocating tolerance from both believers and non-believers. Through clear, concise, and often humorous prose, Comte-Sponville offers a convincing appeal for a new form of spiritual life?one that at its heart celebrates the human need to connect to one another and the universe.</p><p><b>Andr� Comte-Sponville</b> is one of France's preeminent contemporary philosophers. Previously a professor at the Sorbonne, he is the author of<i> The Little Book of Atheist Spirituality</i> and <i>A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues</i>, an international bestseller that has been translated into 25 languages. He lives in Paris.<br><br><b>Nancy Huston</b>&nbsp;is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including the critically acclaimed&nbsp;<i>Fault Lines</i>, which won France's Prix Femina and was shortlisted for the Orange Prize.&nbsp;She has also won the Prix Goncourt des Lyc�en, the Prix du Livre-Inter, the Prix Elle, and the Governor General&#x2019;s Award for Fiction in French.&nbsp;A former resident of Calgary and New Hampshire, she now lives in Paris.At first blush "atheist spirituality" may sound like a contradiction in terms, but French philosopher Comte-Sponville makes a compelling argument for a profound dimension of experience that is god-free. His idea of spirituality also bears no small resemblance to Eastern spirituality, and the philosopher-author does not hesitate to cite great Eastern thinkers in this catalogue of references to great minds grappling with important questions. We can do without religion and without God, the author argues, but we can't do without fidelity and community. Comte-Sponville's humanism is deeply traditional, but the red flag "atheist" will undoubtedly affront religious traditionalists. That's unfortunate, because the author's style of arguing is civil and witty, unlike a lot of public discourse on this subject. He draws deeply on the history of philosophers who have pronounced on the subject of God's existence, disposing of the everything-is-permitted nihilism often associated with atheism. Nor does he argue that religion is dangerous, a stance in vogue among today's bestselling atheists. God just isn't logically necessary, but we can still have love, ethical behavior and even the experience of eternity. Formerly a Sorbonne professor, Comte-Sponville presents big ideas with masterful and witty clarity. For those who prefer Kant to cant, this refreshing little book is perfect.<br> "Publishers Weekly"<br><br>a A wonderful book . . . offers a generosity of spirit, communion and wisdom.a <br>a"The Washington Post" <br>a A truly inspiring essay . . .

Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite texts, with accompanying English translations, are included. Some of the collections, like the famous Laws of Hammurabi, achieved a wide audience; others, like the Laws about Rented Oxen, were scribal exercises limited to a local school center. All, however, reflected contemporary legal practice in the scribes&#39; recordings of contracts, administrative documents, and court cases and also provide historians with evidence of abstractions of legal rules from specific cases. In addition to the texts and translations, the volume includes a list of sources, bibliography, glossary, and numerous indexes.</p><p>Text: English, Greek, Hebrew...a must for students interested in the ancient Near East and law. --<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>...highly recommended to every student of the Bible and the ancient Near East. --<i>Journal of Semitic Studies</i></p><h2>Georgia O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s Hawai&#39;i</h2><p>Georgia O'Keeffe is a legend of 20th-century American art. Her life and work, well documented in her lifetime and since, have taken on mythic proportions. Hawai'i is also mythic in our national psyche-a paradisiacal place of healing and renewal. <br><br>In 1938, the Dole Pineapple Co. invited Georgia O'Keeffe to come to Hawai'i to produce two paintings for their national advertising campaign. Like other great artists of her day, including Kuniyoshi, Sheets, and Noguchi, she accepted, and in the spring of 1939 spent nine weeks the Hawaiian Islands. On Maui, where she was hosted by 12-year-old Patricia Jennings, the daughter of the Hana sugar plantation manager, she had an encounter that would affect both women for the rest of their lives.<br><br>Patricia was an isolated introvert, homeschooled and raised by a highly critical mother. When Georgia O'Keeffe arrived in Hawai'i, she was in the throes of marital duress and health challenges. Georgia and Patricia's 10 days together were deeply bonding and profoundly healing. Patricia was nurtured by a mother figure and Georgia recovered emotionally and physically and produced 20 little known yet magnificent works of art. <br><br>In Georgia O'Keeffe's Hawai'i, Patricia Jennings Morriss tells the story of their encounter, offering glimpses and a fresh look at the process of the great artist through the eyes of a pre-war teen in territorial Hawai'i. O'Keeffe's 20 lush paintings of Island flora and landscapes are reproduced together here for the first time. Reflecting on her time on Maui, O'Keeffe wrote, "I enjoy this drifting off into space on an island. Years later, she added, it was one of "the best things I have done. <br><br>In 1940, O'Keeffe's Hawai'i paintings were exhibited at a An American Place in New York to critical acclaim, yet in the years since, they've only been displayed all together once. In the introduction to Georgia O'Keeffe's Hawaii, art historian Jennifer Saville asserts that O'Keeffe's nine-week sojourn in the Hawaiian Islands helped shape her career, bridging themes examined earlier to later subjects. This heartwarming, informative read fills a gap in our knowledge about the life and work of one of this great artist.

Bartlett, and The American Canvas.The next morning, Dad arranged for Georgia to drive a rental car while he attended a meeting. A smiling Filipino man greeted us and showed us a clean, though rather ancient, Chevrolet. Standing on the hotel's front steps, Georgia screamed at him, "I can't possibly drive that! Get another car at once!&#x201d; I was startled by her outburst. Oh dear, was she going to be difficult?<br><br>"This one good car. You try&#x201d;<br><br>"No. Get something else.&#x201d;<br><br>"I no got nothing else. You try. Easy to drive.&#x201d;<br><br>"I said get another car!&#x201d; She was practically shouting, and passersby had begun to stop. In the thick of battle, the hotel manager came out. The rental clerk seemed close to tears as he explained to the manager that he only had two cars and the newer one was in use. Summoning up my courage, I looked at Georgia and said, "I think you can drive it.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked surprised, and then she smiled. "Well if Patricia thinks I can drive it, I shall.&#x201d;<br><br>The manager showed great relief; and, for a moment, I thought the clerk was going to kiss me.<br><br>After a little practice with the gearshift, we set off for 'Iao Valley, a lush gorge a few miles beyond Wailuku. The day was very still-the only sounds were birdsong and the roaring stream through the valley.<br><br>"This looks like a good place to stop. Can you keep yourself busy for a bit?&#x201d; Georgia set up her easel a few feet from the car. <br><br>Soon there was a slight drizzle. Georgia seemed not to notice until heavy drops began to fall. I ran and helped her get her things into the backseat of the car. To my surprise, she climbed into the back, too. <br><br>"In New Mexico, I often paint in my car. Now turn around and sit quietly.&#x201d; <br><br>I slumped in the front seat and watched the rivulets running down the windshield. I wanted to peek over my shoulder but didn't dare. When I shifted a bit to stretch my legs, Georgia sighed. <br><br>Then, a moment later, she said, "I suppose I could let you watch. But absolutely no talking.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned slowly, putting my knees on the seat and my arms on the back. Georgia was perched on the edge of the backseat, looking intently out the side window. On the canvas her deft fingers made the green oil paints flow into place effortlessly, and I could see the valley walls and the waterfall. Just as she was switching colors, the rain increased dramatically and the view of the cliffs disappeared. <br><br>"Doesn't look as though this is going to stop,&#x201d; she sighed. "You know you are a very privileged girl. I never let anyone watch me work.&#x201d;</p><h2>Green Construction: An Introduction to a Changing Industry</h2><p>What green, sustainable, and high-performance, mean for the construction industry and its workers.

Written in a highly accessible and readable style, Green Construction: An Introduction to a Changing Industry by Alison Dykstra, author of Construction Project Management, presents an overview of an industry that is going through profound changes, many of which are tied to the increase in the use of green construction principles. How buildings are designed, the materials and products used, even construction practices and the nature of work, are all changing because of tightening energy requirements and building performance expectations. Industry professionals &#x2013; designers, engineers, and builders &#x2013; understand that success is increasingly tied to their response to and understanding of these changes.Not another how-to book, nor a sermon on the benefits of environmentalism, Green Construction provides answers to the questions: What is green construction? How is it impacting jobs, workers, and the built environment? And what do these changes look like in the field?Alison Dykstra has a masters degree in architecture from the University of Colorado and has been a licensed architect since 1983. She is a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), from which she received her CDT certification in construction documents technology, and her local chapter of the US Green Building Council. Her work with and commitment to the issues of renewable energy started at the Farallones Institute in the 1970s, where she worked on passive solar systems, alternative construction technologies, and integrated community design systems.<p> Dykstra has been an adjunct faculty member at Santa Rosa Junior College since 1992 and was inspired to write this book by her students. How do we get started in green construction? was a common refrain even among students skeptical of environmentalism. This book is a first step in answering that question.</p><p> Dykstra's interest and skill is in deconstructing complex subjects to make them accessible to those new to a subject, as well as to seasoned professionals interested in broadening their skills.</p></p><h2>Liturgical Sense: The Logic of Rite (Weil Series in Liturgics)</h2><p>Louis Weil looks back on his work shaping the liturgical life of the Episcopal Church through his involvement with the development of The 1979 Book of Common Prayer&#x2015; and looks forward to the future of the church and its liturgical life. Through stories and first-person anecdotes, Weil does &#x201c;narrative theology&#x201d; as only he can. Although most points of reference are to the 1979 BCP, the book is aiming at a more fundamental level&#x2015;not just Episcopal or even Anglican liturgy, but liturgical rites as such: how do they &#x201c;do what they do&#x201d;?&#x2015;or NOT do when they are done badly! &#x201c;Liturgical Sense&#x201d; is two dimensional: both the &#x201c;common sense&#x201d; of liturgical rites and also their &#x201c;aesthetic sense.&#x201d; It is Dr. Weil&#x2019;s contention that in American culture we have an inherent inability to &#x201c;think symbolically.&#x201d; Dr. Weil seeks to encourage a return to &#x201c;liturgical sense&#x201d; across the church.</p><p></p><h2>Colored Pencil: Discover your &#34;inner artist&#34; as you learn to draw a range of popular subjects in colored pencil (Drawing Made Easy)</h2><p><p>Anyone who has always wanted to draw in colored pencil but finds all those colors intimidating can breathe a sigh of relief after opening this book. <i>Drawing Made Easy: Colored Pencil</i> shows readers how to draw almost anything in colored pencil with ease!

It preoccupies our popular culture, our fantasies, and even our moralizing. With our top chefs as deities and finest restaurants as places of pilgrimage, we have made food the stuff of secular seeking and transcendence, finding heaven in a mouthful. But have we come any closer to discovering the true meaning of food in our lives? With inimitable charm and learning, Adam Gopnik takes us on a beguiling journey in search of that meaning as he charts America&#x2019;s recent and rapid evolution from commendably aware eaters to manic, compulsive gastronomes.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: Adam Gopnik again demonstrates his considerable talents in <i>The Table Comes First</i>, a collection of musings on one of his favorite subjects: food. Fans of <em>Paris to the Moon</em> and <em>Through the Children&#x2019;s Gate</em> know that Gopnik is a true gourmand whose tastes have been refined in the kitchen with his friend Alice Waters, on the velvet banquettes of Parisian bistros, and at chaotic New York City takeout counters. These essays cover a broad range of food-related topics, including the origins of the modern restaurant and the arguments for and against eating meat. But Gopnik&#x2019;s overarching mission is to celebrate the pleasures of sitting around a table and sharing a meal with family and friends--a pleasure, he notes, that is at once universal and deeply personal.

We are captivated by an illusion; we applaud the fact that we have been fooled. Why do we enjoy experiencing what seems clearly impossible, or at least beyond our powers of explanation? In <i>Experiencing the Impossible</i>, Gustav Kuhn examines the psychological processes that underpin our experience of magic. Kuhn, a psychologist and a magician, reveals the intriguing&#x2015;and often unsettling&#x2015;insights into the human mind that the scientific study of magic provides. </p><p>Magic, Kuhn explains, creates a cognitive conflict between what we believe to be true (for example, a rabbit could not be in that hat) and what we experience (a rabbit has just come out of that hat!). Drawing on the latest psychological, neurological, and philosophical research, he suggests that misdirection is at the heart of all magic tricks, and he offers a scientific theory of misdirection. He explores, among other topics, our propensity for magical thinking, the malleability of our perceptual experiences, forgetting and misremembering, free will and mind control, and how magic is applied outside entertaiment&#x2015;the use of illusion in human-computer interaction, politics, warfare, and elsewhere. </p><p>We may be surprised to learn how little of the world we actually perceive, how little we can trust what we see and remember, and how little we are in charge of our thoughts and actions. Exploring magic, Kuhn illuminates the complex&#x2015;and almost magical&#x2015;mechanisms underlying our daily activities.</p></p><p>Gustav Kuhn is Reader in Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, and a member of the Magic Circle.<p>"Whether you are someone who is captivated by magic tricks or not, if you care about the human mind, you'll like <i>Experiencing the Impossible</i>.

Hot rods, customs, sport compact cars, muscle cars, and many other cars readily accommodate fiberglass and composite components. Fabricated parts such as air dams, wings, side skirts, and hoods can create a one-of-kind style and function. These exterior parts can also deliver improved performance. Hundreds of interior parts have been fabricated to create the interior environment, including dashes, gauge panels, door panels, consoles, and much more. And many owners of fiberglass and composite cars, such as Corvettes, need to repair a wide range of production parts, using custom fabricated parts. Authors Daniel Burrill and Jeffrey Zurschmeide guide you through fabrication of popular exterior and interior parts as well as common repairs. They show you how to construct molds for simple and complex parts, how to lay up fiberglass parts, and complete a finished part. In addition, you see how to construct carbon fiber parts, including glass strand mat, woven fiberglass cloth, carbon fiber cloth, and hybrid fabrics, for a variety of applications. To add strength to various parts, core materials such as wood, foam, and honeycomb Nomex are often used, and these are covered in great detail. All the relevant tools, including mixing containers, holding containers, saws, scissors, files, and shaping tools, are discussed. The book also reveals how to construct wood patterns to exacting standards from wood, Formica, aluminum, and other materials. A wide range of fabrication and repair projects are included, such as laying up basic fiberglass, repairing cracks and holes, creating a buck/mold, making molds for dashboards, repairing plastic spoilers, and much more.

Wesley's sermons centered on God s unconditional love, freely offered to all through Christ. Wesley preached at coal mines and in fields and sparked a great spiritual renewal. Wesley s published sermons instructed the people in Christian discipleship and explained the core understandings of the Methodist movement.<p> <i>Praying in the Wesleyan Spirit</i> offers contemporary readers an approach to Wesley s spiritual depth. Author Paul Chilcote has transposed 52 of Wesley s standard sermons into flowing devotional prayers that are written in contemporary language, yet faithful to Wesley s message. A scripture reference and a hymn by Charles Wesley accompany each prayer. The prayers offer a means of reflecting on such topics as salvation by faith, yearning for God, and Christian perfection. Like Wesley s sermons, these prayers show a concern to reveal how God works in the world. The prayers also engage the head and hands and heart in the same way that Wesley understood Christian discipleship.</p><p> With 52 prayers, readers may pray one prayer a week for a year and immerse themselves in a <i>short course</i> in Wesleyan thought and theology. This one-of-a-kind prayer book will introduce readers to a rich heritage of Christian discipleship and is a <i>must have</i> devotional book for those active in the Wesleyan tradition. A Scripture Index and a Hymn Index are also included.</p></p><p>Paul W. Chilcote is professor of the Practice of Evangelism at Duke University Divinity School. Chilcote previously served as Nippert Professor of Church History and Wesleyan Studies at the Methodist Theological School in Ohio and, more recently, helped to launch the new campus of Asbury Theological Seminary in Florida. Chilcote is the author of eight books. He is the president of The Charles Wesley Society, and enjoys a special relationship with Mount Angel Abbey in Oregon as a Benedictine oblate. Chilcote is a frequent speaker and workshop leader in applied Wesleyan studies, particularly in the areas of spirituality, worship, discipleship, and evangelism.</p><h2>The Order of Forms: Realism, Formalism, and Social Space</h2><p><p>In literary studies today, debates about the purpose of literary criticism and about the place of formalism within it continue to simmer across periods and approaches. Anna Kornbluh contributes to&#x2014;and substantially shifts&#x2014;that conversation in <i>The Order of Forms</i> by offering an exciting new category, political formalism, which she articulates through the co-emergence of aesthetic and mathematical formalisms in the nineteenth century. Within this framework, criticism can be understood as more affirmative and constructive, articulating commitments to aesthetic expression and social collectivity. <br> <br> Kornbluh offers a powerful argument that political formalism, by valuing forms of sociability like the city and the state in and of themselves, provides a better understanding of literary form and its political possibilities than approaches that view form as a constraint. To make this argument, she takes up the case of literary realism, showing how novels by Dickens, Bront�, Hardy, and Carroll engage mathematical formalism as part of their political imagining. Realism, she shows, is best understood as an exercise in social modeling&#x2014;more like formalist mathematics than social documentation. By modeling society, the realist novel focuses on what it considers the most elementary features of social relations and generates unique political insights. Proposing both this new theory of realism and the idea of political formalism, this inspired, eye-opening book will have far-reaching implications in literary studies.<br> </p></p><p><b>Anna Kornbluh</b> is associate professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She is the author of <i>Realizing Capital: Financial and Psychic Economies in Victorian Realist Form </i>and <i>Marxist Film Theory and "Fight Club"</i>.<br>&#x201c;<i>The Order of Forms</i> offers a probing, ambitious, and innovative argument with far-reaching implications across fields. Kornbluh turns away from dominant particularist and historicist methods in literary and cultural studies and gives shape to a stimulating new set of strategies for thinking the political in the humanities and beyond. That she is capable of bringing together psychoanalysis, Marxism, literary formalism, and mathematics makes this a virtuoso work of theory.&#x201d; (Caroline Levine, Cornell University)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Order of Forms</i> is one of the most exciting books I&#x2019;ve read in several decades. Staging the convergence of discourses that, however historically contemporaneous, have never been rigorously linked together, Kornbluh generates a series of provocative and convincing arguments about literature, criticism, and the agency of form. Her approach makes her a theoretical singularity.&#x201d; (Sianne Ngai, University of Chicago)</p><h2>Edible French: Tasty Expressions and Cultural Bites</h2><p>The idiosyncrasies of language can tell us a lot about a culture.

As we studied the menu, we noticed it was decorated with dozens of French expressions related to food, printed in different retro types.</p><p>Once our orders had been placed, we asked to keep a menu and spent a happy moment translating, explaining, and finding English equivalents for those idioms. The seed of an idea was planted, and two weeks later I started a series of posts on my food blog, <i>Chocolate &amp; Zucchini</i>, to shed light on what I dubbed the &#x201c;edible idioms&#x201d; of the French language.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the idiosyncrasies of languages and what they tell us about a culture, and it is certainly striking to see the French love of food and the importance meals have in daily life translate so richly in the fabric of the language. Matters of the table are considered with such care and attention that whenever the French mind searches for an expression to illustrate a situation, it is likely to come up with a food-related metaphor or simile, one that has to do with bread or cheese or wine.</p><p>Researching those expressions was as much a treat for me as for my readers; this series soon became one of my most popular, and I was often asked whether I had plans to publish them as a book.</p><p>The spark for that came four years later, when M�lina Josserand first contacted me. A French watercolor artist living in London, she was a fan of those posts and was volunteering to illustrate them.</p><p>I was instantly smitten with the playfulness of her work and her eye for color, and after collaborating on a few posts and hitting it off like we&#x2019;d known each other all our lives, we decided to turn my words and her brushstrokes into the book you are now holding in your hands.</p><p>In it you&#x2019;ll find fifty of the most delicious expressions of the French language, some of them favorites from the blog series, some of them all new, with example sentences and M�lina&#x2019;s gorgeous illustrations. You&#x2019;ll also find cultural notes, fun quizzes, and a few very easy but very tasty recipes inspired by some of these idioms. </p><p>We hope you enjoy this colorful window onto the French language and that you&#x2019;ll &#x201c;make your honey out of it.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>Fringe - Sins of the Father (novel #3)</h2><p><p>Never-before-revealed secrets of the characters, leading to the creation of the government&#x2019;s covert Fringe Division.<br><br>In 2008, Peter Bishop is estranged from his father and running shady operations in Southeast Asia.

In addition to writing <em>The Blessing</em> and <em>The Two Sides of Love</em> with John Trent, their book <em>The Language of Love</em> (newly revised and updated) won the Angel Award as the best contribution to family life. His national infomercial, <em>Hidden Keys to Loving Relationships</em>, has been viewed by television audiences all over the world.</p>After only a few chapters, it is obvious why Christian marriage counselor Smalley has sold more than 12 million copies of his videos and previous books. His presentation is highly organized, so that he can summarize each chapter in so many numbered points. He speaks plainly and inculcates his lessons with anecdotes from his clinical practice and his own life that workaday Americans, especially if they are in business and the professions, find easy to identify with and which Smalley weaves cunningly together so that some stories are told all at once, while others are parceled out to create narrative suspense and make the book compelling. Details and metaphors are the stuff of the popular culture: country singers, TV shows, and computer and VCR analogies. The authorities Smalley cites come from the best-seller lists: M. Scott Peck, Stephen R. Covey, John Gray, and Deborah Tannen, among others; not until well into the book are the Bible and Evangelical Christian resources invoked. It helps that the bedrock advice here--to assume personal responsibility for one's life and to love life itself as prerequisites to realizing a happy, permanent marriage--is just that, bedrock, for the modern counseling establishment. Smalley does what he does awfully well, making this <i>the</i> book for staunch Christian couples and an approachable one for enough others to justify Word's confident quarter-million-copy first printing and a 30-city author tour. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Thinking Through Quality Questioning: Deepening Student Engagement</h2><p><p><strong><em>Asking the right questions is the answer</em></strong></p> <p>This groundbreaking book provides teachers with an accessible, research-based blueprint for developing student metacognitive skills and ensuring that students take responsibility for their own learning.

Allison, is an accessible, data-based introduction to methods of survival analysis. Researchers who want to analyze survival data with SAS will find just what they need with this fully updated new edition that incorporates the many enhancements in SAS procedures for survival analysis in SAS 9. Although the book assumes only a minimal knowledge of SAS, more experienced users will learn new techniques of data input and manipulation. Numerous examples of SAS code and output make this an eminently practical book, ensuring that even the uninitiated become sophisticated users of survival analysis. The main topics presented include censoring, survival curves, Kaplan-Meier estimation, accelerated failure time models, Cox regression models, and discrete-time analysis. Also included are topics not usually covered in survival analysis books, such as time-dependent covariates, competing risks, and repeated events. Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, Second Edition, has been thoroughly updated for SAS 9, and all figures are presented using ODS graphics. This new edition also documents major enhancements to the STRATA statement in the LIFETEST procedure; includes a section on the PROBPLOT command, which offers graphical methods to evaluate the fit of each parametric regression model; introduces the new BAYES statement for both parametric and Cox models, which allows the user to do a Bayesian analysis using MCMC methods; demonstrates the use of the counting process syntax as an alternative method for handling time-dependent covariates; contains a section on cumulative incidence functions; and describes the use of the new GLIMMIX procedure to estimate random-effects models for discrete-time data.</p><p>Paul D. Allison is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and President of Statistical Horizons LLC. He is the author of Logistic Regression Using SAS: Theory and Application, Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, and Fixed Effects Regression Methods for Longitudinal Data Using SAS. Paul has also written numerous statistical papers and published extensively on the subject of scientists&#x2019; careers. He frequently teaches public short courses on the methods described in his books."Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, Second Edition, is a prime but by no means the only example of Paul Allison's skill as a writer and teacher. Allison has a perhaps unparalleled ability to write about highly complex topics in a way that is accessible to relatively inexperienced people at the same time that he provides fresh insights and explanations to practitioners who may have thought they knew all there was to know. His writing reflects not only his deep knowledge of statistical methods but also his substantive engagement with them as a first-rate sociologist. Allison writes with the focus and confidence of someone who knows what he is doing and why he is doing it. His discussion of the basics of survival analysis is as clear as one can make it, but he does not gloss over the underlying mathematics, providing extraordinarily clear and detailed discussions of maximum and partial likelihood, Baysian estimation methods, and other topics that are essential to a thorough understanding of the methods. The examples, all of them based on real data, are instructive and thoroughly explained. An important aspect of the examples is that preliminary SAS code needed to arrange the data for analysis is carefully discussed, thus making the book more accessible to those who are new to SAS. For SAS users, I can think of no better place to start one's education regarding survival models, and I would urge anyone who already uses them to give this book a careful read." --Richard T. Campbell, Professor of Biostatistics and Sociology, University of Illinois at Chicago<br><br>"A complete novice to this subject, I learned survival analysis on the fly from a client who had the utmost confidence in my ability.

The second edition offers greater attention both to food justice issues and to economic methods, including extensive economics appendices in a new online Companion Website.</p> <p>As with the first edition, real-world controversies and debates motivate the book&#x2019;s attention to economic principles, policy analysis, nutrition science and contemporary data sources. The book assumes that the reader's concern is not just the economic interests of farmers and food producers but also includes nutrition, sustainable agriculture, food justice, the environment and food security. The goal is to make U.S. food policy more comprehensible to those inside and outside the agri-food sector whose interests and aspirations have been ignored.</p> <p>The chapters cover U.S. agriculture, food production and the environment, international agricultural trade, food and beverage manufacturing, food retail and restaurants, food safety, dietary guidance, food labeling, advertising and federal food assistance programs for the poor.</p> <p>The author is an agricultural economist with many years of experience in the nonprofit advocacy sector, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and as a professor at Tufts University.

While there has been considerable attention by practitioners and academics to development in urban cores and new neighborhoods on the periphery of cities, there has been little attention to the redesign and redevelopment of existing suburbs. The authors, both architects and noted experts on the subject, show how development in existing suburbs can absorb new growth and evolve in relation to changed demographic, technological, and economic conditions. <p> <b>Retrofitting Suburbia</b> was named winner in the Architecture &amp; Urban Planning category of the 2009 American Publishers Awards for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (The PROSE Awards) awarded by The Professional and Scholarly Publishing (PSP) Division of the Association of American Publishers</p></p><p><p>"THE BIBLE OF THE RETROFITTING MOVEMENT." &#x2015;Blair Kamin, architecture critic, Chicago Tribune</p> <p>A guide, with multiple case studies, for redeveloping out-of-date suburban developments into more urban, sustainable places</p> <p>The winner in the Architecture &amp; Urban Planning category of the American Publishers Awards for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (The PROSE Awards)</p> <p>The last fifty years have been dominated by the reproduction of sprawl development patterns.

Acock's <em>A Gentle Introduction to Stata, Sixth Edition</em> is aimed at new Stata users who want to become proficient in Stata. After reading this introductory text, new users will be able not only to use Stata well but also to learn new aspects of Stata.</p> <p>Acock assumes that the user is not familiar with any statistical software. This assumption of a blank slate is central to the structure and contents of the book. Acock starts with the basics; for example, the part of the book that deals with data management begins with a careful and detailed example of turning survey data on paper into a Stata-ready dataset on the computer. When explaining how to go about basic exploratory statistical procedures, Acock includes notes that will help the reader develop good work habits. This mixture of explaining good Stata habits and good statistical habits continues throughout the book.</p> <p>Acock is quite careful to teach the reader all aspects of using Stata. He covers data management, good work habits (including the use of basic do-files), basic exploratory statistics (including graphical displays), and analyses using the standard array of basic statistical tools (correlation, linear and logistic regression, and parametric and nonparametric tests of location and dispersion). He also successfully introduces some more advanced topics such as multiple imputation and multilevel modeling in a very approachable manner. Acock teaches Stata commands by using the menus and dialog boxes while still stressing the value of do-files. In this way, he ensures that all types of users can build good work habits. Each chapter has exercises that the motivated reader can use to reinforce the material.</p> <p>The tone of the book is friendly and conversational without ever being glib or condescending. Important asides and notes about terminology are set off in boxes, which makes the text easy to read without any convoluted twists or forward referencing. Rather than splitting topics by their Stata implementation, Acock arranges the topics as they would appear in a basic statistics textbook; graphics and postestimation are woven into the material in a natural fashion. Real datasets, such as the General Social Surveys from 2002, 2006, and 2016, are used throughout the book. </p> <p>The focus of the book is especially helpful for those in the behavioral and social sciences because the presentation of basic statistical modeling is supplemented with discussions of effect sizes and standardized coefficients. Various selection criteria, such as semipartial correlations, are discussed for model selection. Acock also covers a variety of commands available for evaluating reliability and validity of measurements.</p> <p>The sixth edition incorporates new features of Stata 15.&nbsp; All menus, dialog boxes, and instructions for using the point-and-click interface have been updated. Power-and-sample-size calculations for linear regression are demonstrated using Stata 15's new power rsquared command. This edition also includes new sections that describe how to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity, how to compute effect sizes for t tests and ANOVA models, how to use margins and marginsplot to interpret results of linear and logistic regression models, and how to use full-information maximum-likelihood (FIML) estimation with SEM to address problems with missing data.</p></p><p><b> </b><p><b>Alan Acock</b> is a sociologist and a University Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the School of Social and Behavioral Health Sciences at Oregon State University. </p></p><h2>Redefining the Role of the Community Interpreter: The Concept of Role-space</h2><p>'Redefining the Role of the Community Interpreter' questions the traditional notion of 'role' that is so often taught on interpreter education and training courses and, more often than not, prescribed by the Codes of Ethics/Practice/Conduct published by institutional users and providers of interpreting services. By examining the nature of face-to-face interactions and drawing on the most recent research into community and public service interpreting, the authors propose and describe a wholly new approach to the role of the interpreter; one based on research and the experiences of the authors, both of whom have, for many years, taught postgraduate interpreting courses and, for even more years, interpreted in a wide variety of settings, from international conferences to social services departments, from presidential addresses to benefits offices, and from doctors&#x2019; surgeries to Courts of Appeal. The &#x2018;role-space&#x2019; model treats all interactions as unique and offers the interpreter a tool to prepare for and participate in those interactions. Excellent language skills are taken for granted, as is the integrity of the interpreter; what is new is the freedom of the interpreter to make appropriate professional decisions based on the reality of the interaction they are interpreting.</p><p>Peter Llewellyn-Jones qualified as an interpreter in 1972 and has, for more than twenty five years, taught vocational, undergraduate and postgraduate courses for both signed and spoken language interpreters.

For countless generations, people have asked and answered existentially urgent and provocative questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and how to be a good person.<br>Religions of the world have traditionally been the outlet for dealing with mystery, and in The Enduring Quest for Meaning: Humans, Mystery, and the Story of Religion, Michael Horace Barnes presents a chronicle of the human quest to make sense of these mysteries through religious traditions. Tracing this quest from the mythic tales of hunter-gatherers to modern scientific atheism, this text sheds light not only on the mysteries people face, but--more importantly--on the people who face them. With charts, pictures, and discussion questions at the conclusion of each chapter, The Enduring Quest for Meaning makes questions of ultimate meaning accessible and engaging for any audience. <br><br></p><p>Michael Horace Barnes is a professor of religious studies at the University of Dayton.At a time when many students question the value of religion, Michael Horace Barnes's The Enduring Quest for Meaning provides them with an engagingly written text that demonstrates why the religious quest not only endures but thrives. Barnes shows how human religiousness is grounded in our shared humanity. This book will appeal to students who are religious, as well as to those who are suspicious of religion. As a theology professor, I appreciate that although the book comes to the study of religion as a way to learn about humanity and describes its approach as "from the outside," it presents the human person as inherently open to the infinite and approaches religion sympathetically. This book offers an impressive integration of insights from multiple disciplines, including religious studies, theology, philosophy, history, psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Although it is not an introduction to major religions of the world, its rich examples from a wide variety of religious traditions provide concrete illustrations of the larger points being made and will spark student interest in exploring particular religious traditions.<br>--Donna Teevan, PhD<br>Associate Professor, Theology and Religious Studies Department<br>Seattle University<br>Michael Barnes's book, The Enduring Quest for Meaning, is the best book I have ever found for teaching courses on religion--written clearly and intelligibly, not assuming too much knowledge on the part of its readers, most of whom are college freshmen. It introduces the academic study of religion in a fascinating, well-organized, systematic way that relates its topic to the lives of students. The book carefully distinguishes the humanistic study of religion--which this book represents--from the believer's theological study without devaluing the latter.<br> This volume includes footnotes to relevant academic sources and key chapters that make the book's story clear. The final chapter's treatment of postmodernism is helpful to the understanding of religion in the twenty-first century.<br> I recommend The Enduring Quest for Meaning to anyone who teaches religious studies or who simply wants to gain a new perspective on the long story of religion as a human response to the mystery of the universe.<br>--Alan Meyers, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Religion<br>Lindenwood University<br>Michael Horace Barnes's recent book, The Enduring Quest for Meaning, is a comprehensive and well-constructed introduction to religion as human response to mystery. It emphasizes the human heart's longing for God while summarizing the history of human religiousness: the evolution of religions from primitive to modern and all the dimensions of established and unestablished religions. The book talks about a God that transcends the limits of particular religions' titles or manner of relating to God or God's existence. The essential point in all courses in religion is the reality of human consciousness and its need to think beyond the visible and act in accordance with this conviction.<br>The book is coherent, useful, and attractive: coherent because of its examples of how humans have understood Ultimate Reality; useful because of its footnotes and charts and summaries of terms; and attractive in the images that illustrate topics (a picture is frequently "worth a thousand words").<br>--James V. Zeitz<br>Our Lady of the Lake University<br>"I am delighted and energized by Michael Horace Barnes's The Enduring Quest for Meaning: Humans, Mystery, and the Story of Religion. As a theologian in a Catholic liberal arts college, I have found it difficult to find texts that offer academic excellence in the analysis of the development of religion while maintaining a respectful demeanor that is supportive of religious faith. This text strikes the perfect balance. It both challenges and inspires. I have enthusiastically adopted it for my popular course on religion and culture. As someone actively engaged in interreligious dialogue, I am also impressed with its positive anthropology and the way it situates religiousness as a natural response to the universal need to make meaning of human experience."<br>--John B.

There is a common perception that marriage to a U.S. citizen puts undocumented immigrants on a quick-and-easy path to U.S. citizenship. But for people who have entered the U.S. unlawfully and live here without papers, the line to legal status is neither short nor easy, even for those with spouses who are U.S. citizens.<br><br><em>Becoming Legal: Immigration Law and Mixed-Status Families</em> follows mixed-status couples down the long and bumpy road of immigration processing. It explores how they navigate every step along the way, from the decision to undertake legalization, to the immigration interview in Ciudad Ju�rez, Mexico, to the effort to put together a case of "extreme hardship" so that the undocumented family member can return. Author Ruth Gomberg-Mu�oz also discusses families' efforts to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of immigration processing--both for those who are successful and those who are not.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ruth Gomberg-Mu�oz </strong>is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Loyola University Chicago.

Everyone should read this work to understand our flawed immigration system and how it affects millions of real lives. By combining individual cases and voices with explanations of the complex legal dimension, Gomberg-Mu�oz is able to provide a clear picture of this heart-wrenching process."--Enrique C. Ochoa, <em>California State University, Los Angeles</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Becoming Legal</em> will be a classic text for introductory courses on globalization and migration, on the U.S. immigration system, and on 'the immigrant experience.'

Trained as a jurist and employed as a counsellor, librarian, and historian, he made famous contributions to logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics, yet viewed his own aspirations as ultimately ethical and theological, and married these theoretical concerns with politics, diplomacy, and an equally broad range of practical reforms: juridical, economic, administrative, technological, medical, and ecclesiastical. Maria Rosa Antognazza&#39;s pioneering biography not only surveys the full breadth and depth of these theoretical interests and practical activities, it also weaves them together for the first time into a unified portrait of this unique thinker and the world from which he came. At the centre of the huge range of Leibniz&#39;s apparently miscellaneous endeavours, Antognazza reveals a single master project lending unity to his extraordinarily multifaceted life&#39;s work. Throughout the vicissitudes of his long life, Leibniz tenaciously pursued the dream of a systematic reform and advancement of all the sciences, to be undertaken as a collaborative enterprise supported by an enlightened ruler; these theoretical pursuits were in turn ultimately grounded in a practical goal: the improvement of the human condition and thereby the celebration of the glory of God in His creation. As well as tracing the threads of continuity that bound these theoretical and practical activities to this all-embracing plan, this illuminating study also traces these threads back into the intellectual traditions of the Holy Roman Empire in which Leibniz lived and throughout the broader intellectual networks that linked him to patrons in countries as distant as Russia and to correspondents as far afield as China.</p><p>In this first intellectual biography of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), Maria Rosa Antognazza surveys the full range of the philosopher&#39;s interests and activities and offers a unified portrait of a unique thinker, identifying the master project that inspired and coordinated his huge range of apparently miscellaneous endeavors.Maria Rosa Antognazza is Professor of Philosophy at King&#39;s College London. She is the author of Leibniz on the Trinity and the Incarnation: Reason and Revelation in the Seventeenth Century and has contributed to The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy.</p><h2>Cambridge Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary with CD-ROM</h2><p>A fully updated edition of the best-selling Cambridge Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary.

He then unfolds the real-life implications of this paradigm of Christian community for local church structure, strategies for partnering, public witness, and interreligious engagement.</p><p>Craig L. Nessan is Professor of Contextual Theology and Academic Dean at Wartburg Theological Seminary, Dubuque, Iowa. He is author of Beyond Maintenance to Mission: A Theology of the Congregation, Second Edition (2010), Transforming Leadership: New Vision for a Church in Mission (with Norma Cook Everist, 2008), Many Members, Yet One Body (2004), and Give Us This Day: A Lutheran Proposal for Ending World Hunger (2003)."The body of Christ, distorted almost beyond recognition by what popularly passes as church life these days, is faithfully portrayed by the insightful, biblically and theologically grounded reflections of Craig Nessan as the Shalom Church, which engages peacemaking, social justice, care of creation, and respect for human dignity." --Rev. Dennis Jacobsen, Director, Gamaliel National Clergy Caucus<br><br>"It is encouraging to those of us who have tried so hard to believe in the 'reality' of the church and work for its 'realization' that new voices have taken up that challenge today and are addressing the religious situation in North America and the world with imagination, zest, and hope. I am delighted to commend Craig Nessan's thoughtful book, and I hope that it will be read widely and attentively throughout the churches." --Douglas John Hall, Professor of Theology Emeritus, McGill University, Montreal</p><h2>We Hold These Truths: Catholic Reflections on the American Proposition (A Sheed &amp; Ward Classic)</h2><p>The 1960 publication of <i>We Hold These Truths</i> marked a significant event in the history of modern American thought. Since that time, Sheed &amp; Ward has kept the book in print and has published several studies of John Courtney Murray's life and work. We are proud to present a new edition of this classic text, which features a comprehensive introduction by Peter Lawler that places Murray in the context of Catholic and American history and thought while revealing his relevance today. <br><br>From the new Introduction by Peter Lawler:<br><br>The Jesuit John Courtney Murray (1904-67) was, in his time, probably the best known and most widely respected American Catholic writer on the relationship between Catholic philosophy and theology and his country's political life. The highpoint of his influence was the publication of <i>We Hold These Truths</i> in the same year as an election of our country's first Catholic president. Those two events were celebrated by a <i>Time</i> cover story (December 12, 1960) on Murray's work and influence. The story's author, Protestant Douglas Auchincloss, reported that it was "The most relentlessly intellectual cover story I've done." His amazingly wide ranging and dense-if not altogether accurate-account of Murray's thought was crowned with a smart and pointed conclusion: "If anyone can help U.S. Catholics and their non-Catholic countrymen toward the disagreement that precedes understanding-John Courtney Murray can." <br><br>. . .</p><p><b>Father John Courtney Murray</b> was one of America's foremost theologians. Born in New York City in 1904, he held degrees from Boston College, Woodstock College, and the Gregorian University in Rome, where he received his doctorate in theology. He was professor of theology at Woodstock College and editor of <i>Theological Studies</i> for over twenty-five years.</p><h2>Chess Master vs. Chess Amateur (Dover Chess)</h2><p><p>These 25 chess games played between master and amateur were chosen, arranged, and annotated to help amateurs improve their games. What better way could the amateur have of learning to exploit the weak play of fellow amateurs than to study how a master would handle such situations? Selected by former World Chess Champion Max Euwe and Walter Meiden, a typical amateur player, the games point out graphically how the chess master takes advantage of characteristic errors of the amateur.<br>In general, the games have been presented in order of the degree of skill of the amateur. The early games were played against beginners; later games, against "coffeehouse" players of various skill levels; the last games, against amateur "book" players. Each game, with commentary by Dr. Euwe, was chosen to illustrate a specific aspect of chess, from various openings to a number of typical chess situations. By carefully studying these games, the amateur player will learn how to recognize and avoid a variety of weak strategic and tactical moves.<br>Dr. Euwe's helpful and informative commentary on each contest consists of a discussion of significant moves in the game, an analysis of the opening used and explanations of important chess concepts as they arise. Often, he includes a detailed analysis of tactical variations that might have been played as alternatives. The result is an indispensable aid for amateurs seeking to raise the quality of their games as well as a book that can be read with profit by chess players at every level of expertise.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Batik and Tie Dye Techniques</h2><p><p>In this comprehensive, generously illustrated handbook, textile artist and teacher Nancy Belfer leads readers step by step through the technique required to successfully create imaginative and beautiful batiks and tie-dyed textiles. Even beginners, following the instructions in this thorough, thoughtful guidebook, can create colorful and exciting textiles that will add distinctive touches to clothing, home furnishings, and more.<br>The author first reviews the early uses of dyes and the application of resist dye processes to textiles, then explores the history and tradition of batik, emphasizing the traditional Javanese batik method. She then covers every facet of the process of designing and making batiks, from selecting proper equipment and supplies, setting up a studio and making preliminary drawings and sketches to preparing the wax, applying the wax to cloth, applying dyes, and setting color.<br>Ms. Belfer follows a similar format in reviewing the history and traditions of tie dye and the art of designing with tie resist techniques, clearly demonstrating each stage of the process, including tritik, clamping, and discharge methods. Over 100 photographs and 28 diagrams make it easy to follow the various procedures. A helpful list of materials and equipment suppliers rounds out this excellent guide.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Lost and Found</h2><p><p><strong>Set sail on a wonderful adventure in this toddler-friendly board book from award-winning, bestselling picture book creator, Oliver Jeffers!</strong></p><p>There once was a boy... and one day a penguin arrives on his doorstep. The boy decides the penguin must be lost and tries to return him. But no one seems to be missing a penguin. So the boy decides to take the penguin home himself, and they set out in his row boat on a journey to the South Pole.</p><p>But when they get there, the boy discovers that maybe home wasn't what the penguin was looking for after all...</p></p><p><p>OLIVER JEFFERS graduated from The University of Ulster in 2001 with First Class honours. His outstanding talent has been recognised by several high-pro?le awards, including the Nestl� Children's Book Prize Gold Award.<i>Lost and Found</i>animation was broadcast on Channel 4. Oliver lives and works in Brookyln, New York.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;Once there was a boy who found a penguin at his door. From this opening line to the very end, this gentle story of friendship will capture young readers' imaginations. The child assumes that the penguin is lost, which is logical since the lumpy black-and-white bird does look awfully forlorn. Determined to help the creature find its way home, he discovers that penguins come from the South Pole, and the two board a rowboat. During their long sea voyage, the youngster passes the time by telling his companion many stories. However, when they finally reach their destination, he realizes that the penguin was not lost, but just lonely and looking for a friend. The soft watercolor paintings feature simple shapes and a palette that ranges from pale to bold. The boy has a square body, stick legs, and a round head with tiny dot eyes and an expressive mouth. For much of the tale, the characters are placed on crisp white backdrops, while colorful ocean scenes depict their journey. The text's subtle humor and the appealing visuals make this title a wonderful read-aloud.<i>&#x2013;Genevieve Gallagher, Murray Elementary School, Charlottesville, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It covers all aspects of flour-milling, yeast, bread ovens and the different types of bread and flour available. It contains an exhaustive collection of recipes, everything from plain brown wholemeal or saffron cake to drop scones and croissants; all described with her typical elegance and unrivaled knowledge. Even how to make your own yeast and keep it. But more than just a list of recipes, it is an insight into an interesting and informative home-baker.<br><br>Inquire within on any point connected with baking and Miss David has the answer. Nor does it omit the history of bread making from the Exodus onwards, the iniquities of sliced bread and uncovers the dubious practices of some flour millers and bread manufacturers in the UK and elsewhere with amusing anecdotes and personal observations throughout. <br><br>The writing style of this book has aged well and adds greatly to its charm. This is a book that should be included in every food lover&#x2019;s collection, not just for those who love to cook, but those who enjoy reading about food and its history. It is also an absolute must for keen bakers.</p><p>&#39;What David is really out to do is to explore the role of bread in English life over the past few centuries. Hence her recipe-section, too, proves to be a magnificent historical anthology filled with lore from every source imaginable - Robert May, Hannah Glasse, Eliza Acton, forgotten Women&#39;s Institute compilations, professional baking manuals, letters from readers...She goes as far afield as pizza, croissants, and a quiche involving Roquefort or other blue cheese. But her focus remains British breads, from Irish soda-bread (still called &#34;a cake of bread&#34; on its home turf) to crumpets...Generous quotations from memoirists, novelists, travelers, and knowledgeable acquaintances are interspersed among the old and modern recipes - without seeming in the least like window-dressing. &#39; Kirkus Review</p><h2>Case Closed, Vol. 9</h2><p>The Junior Detective League takes action!

Yet the lives of these individuals are wound up in the larger story of God's purpose for his people. Looking beyond the well-known surface of these stories Joyce Baldwin explores the meaning of the biblical history of Israel's vital transition from a confederation of tribes to nationhood under a king. Bible students at all levels will find that this commentary provides an excellent introduction to the critical issues of authorship, date, composition and structure of Samuel, as well as an able discussion of its theological themes. Written in a clear and straightforward style, here is a worthy addition to the acclaimed Tyndale Commentary series. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>The late Joyce G. Baldwin was Principal of Trinity College, Bristol."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)</p><h2>United in Autism: Finding Strength inside the Spectrum</h2><p>A diagnosis of autism can rock a family's world. The toll it takes on everyone involved can be one of isolation; a child who doesn't respond to the world around them, a parent who gives dedication, patience and love often with no expressible love given back. It's a messy equation with huge emotional and financial costs. As a mother of a daughter with autism, Julie Hornok has experienced her fair share of these parenting challenges, and now brings together thirty inspiring and heartfelt stories from parents raising children from all places on the spectrum and from all corners of the world. These mothers and fathers have experienced some of the worst of what this disorder can do, but in seeking help, they found it...and more. Now they pay it forward by sharing their accounts and giving back to the autism community. <i>United in Autism: Finding Strength inside the Spectrum</i> offers understanding, comfort and hope as well as global allies and strength to those who feel alone.</p><p>When her daughter, Lizzie, was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, Julie Hornok jumped into researching and implementing a thirty-hours-a-week home-therapy program. A few years later, as her daughter made good progress, Julie founded the non-profit, United in Autism, which provides pampering events that bring autism moms hope and acceptance. She has published short stories in multiple Chicken Soup for the Soul books and is a 2017 Writer&#39;s Digest Annual Writing Competition Award Winner. Her work has also appeared in Scary Mommy, Parenting Special Needs Magazine, Autism Parenting Magazine, The Mighty, That&#39;s Inappropriate, Finding Cooper&#39;s Voice, and many more. Julie is passionate about supporting families with autism and lives in Texas with her husband and three children."She (Hornok) interviewed 30 parents of children with autism, based everywhere from Missouri to Singapore...Each piece is concise, thought-provoking, and illustrated with at least one black-and-white family photograph...This book offers both lessons and hope. A well-written and reassuring set of true stories about autism." - Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Autism can be a lonely journey, writes the author, who helps bridge the gap for isolated parents with this offering, which documents her process of implementing an in-home speech, occupational therapy program, applied behavioral analysis, and dietary changes...Those in search of stories of solidarity will find that and more here."- Library Journal<br><br>''Julie Hornok does an incredible job of curating the real-life stories of these fascinating children and their parents, and this book will undoubtedly open the eyes and hearts of all who read it'' --Wendy Fournier, President, National Autism Association<br><br>'''Wise,' 'authentic,' and 'knowledgeable' can hardly describe this beautiful book. To better understand the inner world of an autistic child brings the reader to action in the outer world. Whether you have an autistic child or not, this author's work is motivating. Readers will thank Julie for bringing forth the voice of silence.'' --Jackie Waldman, Author of the Courage to Give series<br><br>''<i>United in Autism</i> provided me with security in accepting my son's autism and, at the same time, not giving up on getting better despite the challenge.

He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we'd ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes...I wasn't altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?"</p><p>When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl. Something dark and secretive that could not be named. </p><p>Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten's childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn't exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested...</p><p>And then the "games" began. </p><p>With <i>A Wolf at the Table,</i> Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, <i>A Wolf at the Table</i> will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It's a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope.</p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, April 2008: When I started reading <i>A Wolf at the Table</i>, I thought I knew what to expect. Augusten Burroughs captures intense experience with an inexplicably cool remove, imparting a stillness and purity to emotions that would likely run amok in anyone else's hands. I love this quality of his writing, and it's present in full force in this memoir of a childhood spent in thrall to a predatory and deeply unpredictable father. What I wasn't prepared for was the suspense--the dread-filled, nearly sonorous waiting for the worst to happen. An artful sort of bait-and-switch happens in the telling: Burroughs brings you to the brink of a terrible catharsis more than once, but the break in tension never comes. It is profoundly sad, remarkably tender, and fueled by a sense of love and reverence that only a child knows. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br><p><b>Augusten Burroughs </b>is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Possible Side Effects, Magical </i><i>Thinking</i>, <i>Dry</i>, <i>Running with Scissors</i>, and <i>Sellevision</i>.

Kern Holoman, <em>New York Review of Books</em></p><p>"A conscientious scholar passionate about his subject. Mr. Walker makes the man and his age come to life. These three volumes will be the definitive work to which all subsequent Liszt biographies will aspire."&#x2015;Harold C. Schonberg, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></p><p>"What distinguishes Walker from Liszt's dozens of earlier biographers is that he is equally strong on the music and the life. A formidable musicologist with a lively polemical style, he discusses the composer's works with greater understanding and clarity than any previous biographer.

Evil stalks us now in disembodied spirits; immortal wraiths once clothed in flesh when angel and women bred; spirits released from their fleshly prisons when their bodies were destroyed for drinking the blood of men. Evil also lives inside of the common man; set free when pride kills reason and eats integrity whole. There is evil that entraps us and evil that tugs from within. But neither have control until we choose to relent. Evil is a choice of action, of thoughts entertained too long, of arrogance pushing aside the last vestiges of compassion. Evil resides within the problem of choice. What is evil? Could it be as simple as pernicious selfishness? Could it be the drive for immediate gratification without regard for others? Man&#39;s life is limited; one hundred years or less. But, the souls of angel and watcher are eternal. Consider how much evil can be wrought through the millennia of immediate gratification on an eternal scale. By contrasting and comparing ancient texts such as Enoch, Jasher, Jubilees, the Bible, and various others containing stories of the creation of angels, demons, and man, a full and panoramic history of evil is produced. In this history the startling revelation of the descent of man and angels, and the evolution of evil on earth is clearly revealed.</p><p>This little book is a summary of many texts written between 200 BC and 200 AD on the subject of Fallen Angels.Joseph Lumpkin has a long and varied background in research and writing.

Or maybe it just felt like it took longer. Maybe it was nerves.</p><p>I tipped my head in thought.</p><p>Maybe not nerves exactly. Maybe anticipation.</p><p>Anticipation that after weeks of talking, weeks of waiting, and weeks of planning, we were finally here. Finally back. I lifted my hand and touched the collar&#x2014;Nathaniel&#x2019;s collar.</p><p>My fingertips danced over the familiar lines and traced along the diamonds. I moved my head from side to side, reacquainting myself with the collar&#x2019;s feel.</p><p>There were no words to describe how I felt wearing Nathan�iel&#x2019;s collar again. The closest I could come was to compare it to a puzzle. A puzzle with the last piece finally in place. Yes, for the last few weeks, Nathaniel and I had been living as lovers, but we both felt incomplete. His recollaring of me&#x2014;his reclaiming of me&#x2014;had been what was missing. It sounded odd even to me, but I finally felt like I was his again.</p><p>The hired car eventually reached Nathaniel&#x2019;s house and pulled into his long drive. Lights flickered from the windows. He had set the timer, anticipating my arrival in the dark. Such a small gesture, but a touching one. One that showed, like much he did, how he kept me firmly at the forefront of his mind.</p><p>I jingled my keys as I walked up the drive to his front door. My keys. To his house. He&#x2019;d given me a set of keys a week ago. I didn&#x2019;t live with him, but I spent a fair amount of time at his house. He said it only made sense for me to be able to let myself in or to lock up when I left.</p><p>Apollo, Nathaniel&#x2019;s golden retriever, rushed me when I opened the door. I rubbed his head and let him outside for a few minutes. I didn&#x2019;t keep him out for too long&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t sure if Na�thaniel would arrive home early, but if he did, I wanted to be in place. I wanted this weekend to be perfect.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay,&#x201d; I told Apollo after stopping in the kitchen to refill his water bowl. Apollo obeyed all of Nathaniel&#x2019;s orders, but thank�fully, he listened to me this time. Normally, he would follow me up the stairs, and tonight that would be odd.</p><p>I quickly left the kitchen and made my way upstairs to my old room. The room that would be mine on weekends.</p><p>I undressed, placing my clothes in a neat pile on the edge of the twin bed. On this, Nathaniel and I had been in agreement. I would share his bed Sunday through Thursday nights, anytime I stayed over, but on Friday and Saturday nights, I would sleep in the room he reserved for his submissives.</p><p>Now that we had a more traditional relationship during the week, we both wanted to make sure we remained in the proper mind-set on weekends. That mind-set would be easier to main�tain for both of us if we slept separately. For both of us, yes, but perhaps more so for Nathaniel. He rarely shared a bed with his submissives, and having a romantic relationship with one was completely new to him.</p><p>I stepped naked into the playroom. Nathaniel had led me around the room last weekend&#x2014;explaining, discussing, and showing me things I&#x2019;d never seen and several items I&#x2019;d never heard of.</p><p>At its core, it was an unassuming room&#x2014;hardwood floors, deep, dark brown paint, handsome cherry armoires, even a long table carved of rich wood. However, the chains and shackles, the padded leather bench and table, and the wooden whipping bench gave away the room&#x2019;s purpose.</p><p>A lone pillow waited for me below the hanging chains. I dropped to my knees on it, situating myself into the position Na�thaniel explained I was to be in whenever I waited for him in the playroom&#x2014;butt resting on my heels, back straight, right hand on top of my left in my lap, fingers not intertwined, and head down.</p><p>I got into position and waited.</p><p>Time inched forward.</p><p>I finally heard him enter through the front door.</p><p>&#x201c;Apollo,&#x201d; he called, and while I knew he spoke Apollo&#x2019;s name so he could take him outside again, another reason was to alert me who it was that entered the house. To give me time to pre�pare myself. Perhaps for him to listen for footsteps from over�head. Footsteps that would tell him I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for his arrival. I felt proud he would hear nothing.</p><p>I closed my eyes. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long now. I imagined what Nathaniel was doing&#x2014;taking Apollo outside, feeding him maybe. Would he undress downstairs? In his bedroom? Or would he enter the playroom wearing his suit and tie?</p><p><i>Doesn&#x2019;t matter,</i> I told myself. <i>Whatever Nathaniel has planned will be perfect. </i></p><p>I strained my ears&#x2014;he was walking up the stairs now. Alone. No dog followed.</p><p>Somehow, the atmosphere of the room changed when he walked in. The air became charged, and the space between us nearly hummed. In that moment, I understood&#x2014;I was his, yes. I had been correct with that assumption. But even more so, even more important, perhaps, he was mine.</p><p>My heart raced.</p><p>&#x201c;Very nice, Abigail,&#x201d; he said, and walked to stand in front of me. His feet were bare. I noted he had changed out of his suit and into a pair of black jeans.</p><p>I closed my eyes again. Cleared my mind. Focused inwardly. Forced myself to remain still under his scrutiny.</p><p>He walked to the table, and I heard a drawer open. For a minute, I tried to remember everything in the drawers, but I stopped myself and once again forced my mind to quiet itself.</p><p>He came back to stand at my side. Something firm and leather trailed down my spine.</p><p><i>Riding crop. </i></p><p>&#x201c;Perfect posture,&#x201d; he said as the crop ran up my spine. &#x201c;I ex�pect you to be in this position whenever I tell you to enter this room.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt relieved he was satisfied with my posture. I wanted so much to please him tonight. To show him I was ready for this. That we were ready. He had been so worried.</p><p>Of course, not a bit of worry or doubt could be discerned now. Not in his voice. Not in his stance. His demeanor in the playroom was utter and complete control and confidence.</p><p>He dragged the riding crop down my stomach and then back up. Teasing.</p><p>Damn. I loved the riding crop.</p><p>I kept my head down even though I wanted to see his face. To meet his eyes. But I knew the best gift I could give him was my absolute trust and obedience, so I kept my head down with my eyes focused on the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Stand up.&#x201d;</p><p>I rose slowly to my feet, knowing I stood directly under the chains. Normally, he kept them up for storage, but they were lowered tonight.</p><p>&#x201c;Friday night through Sunday afternoon, your body is mine,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;As we agreed, the kitchen table and library are still yours. There, and only there, are you to speak your mind. Re�spectfully, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Both of his hands traced across my shoulders, down my arms. One hand slipped between my breasts and dropped to where I was wet and aching.</p><p>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; he said, rubbing my outer lips, &#x201c;is your responsibility. I want you waxed bare as often as possible. If I decide you have neglected this responsibility, you will be punished.&#x201d;</p><p>And again, we had agreed to this.</p><p>&#x201c;In addition, it is your responsibility to ensure your waxer does an acceptable job. I will allow no excuses. Is that under�stood?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&#x201c;You may answer,&#x201d; he said. I heard the smile in his voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Master.&#x201d;</p><p>He slipped a finger between my folds and I felt his breath in my ear. &#x201c;I like you bare.&#x201d; His finger swirled around my clit. &#x201c;Slick and smooth. Nothing between your pussy and whatever I decide to do to it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Fuck. </i></p><p>Then he moved behind me and cupped my ass. &#x201c;Have you been using your plug?&#x201d;</p><p>I waited.</p><p>&#x201c;You may answer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Master.&#x201d;</p><p>His finger made its way back to the front of me, and I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from moaning.</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ask you that again,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;From now on, it is your responsibility to prepare your body to accept my cock in any manner I decide to give it to you.&#x201d; He ran a finger around the rim of my ear. &#x201c;If I want to fuck your ear, I expect your ear to be ready.&#x201d; He hooked his finger in my ear and pulled. I kept my head down. &#x201c;Do you understand? Answer me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Master.&#x201d;</p><p>He lifted my arms above my head, buckling first one wrist and then the other to the chains at my side. &#x201c;Do you remember this?&#x201d; he asked, his warm breath tickling my hair. &#x201c;From our first weekend?&#x201d;</p><p>Again, I said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Very nice, Abigail,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just so there&#x2019;s no misunderstand�ing, for the rest of the evening, or until I tell you differently, you may not speak or vocalize in any way. There are two exceptions&#x2014; the first being the use of your safe words. You are to use them at any point you feel the need. No repercussions or consequences will ever follow the use of your safe words. Second, when I ask if you are okay, I expect an immediate and honest answer.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t wait for a response, of course. I wasn&#x2019;t to give one. Without warning, his hands slipped back down to where I ached for him. Since my head was lowered, I watched one of his fingers slide inside me, and I bit the inside of my cheek again to keep from moaning.</p><p>Shit, his hands felt good.</p><p>&#x201c;How wet you are already.&#x201d; He pushed deeper and twisted his wrist. <i>Fuck.</i> &#x201c;Usually, I would taste you myself, but tonight, I feel like sharing.&#x201d;</p><p>He removed himself, and the emptiness was immediate. Before I could think much about it, I felt his slippery finger at my mouth. &#x201c;Open, Abigail, and taste how ready you are for me.&#x201d; He trailed his finger around my open lips before easing it inside my mouth.</p><p>I&#x2019;d tasted myself before, out of curiosity, but never so much at one time and never off of Nathaniel&#x2019;s finger. It felt so de�praved, so feral.</p><p>Damn, it turned me on.</p><p>&#x201c;Taste how sweet you are,&#x201d; he said as I licked myself off his finger.</p><p>I treated his finger as if it were his cock&#x2014;running my tongue along it, sucking gently at first. I wanted him. Wanted him in�side me. I sucked harder, imagining his cock in my mouth.</p><p><i>You will not release until I give you permission, and I will be very stingy with my permission.</i> His words from the office floated through my mind, and I choked back a moan before it left my mouth. It would be a long night.</p><p>&#x201c;I changed my mind,&#x201d; he said when I finished cleaning his fin�ger. &#x201c;I want a taste after all.&#x201d; He crushed his lips to mine and forced my mouth open. His lips were brutal&#x2014;powerful and de�manding in their quest to taste me.</p><p>Damn, I&#x2019;d have a stroke if he kept that up.</p><p>He pulled back and lifted my chin. &#x201c;Look at me.&#x201d;</p><p>For the first time since he entered the room, I met his eyes&#x2014; they were steady and green. His tongue ran over his lips, and he smiled. &#x201c;Every time sweeter than the last.&#x201d;</p><p>I forced my eyes to remain on his even though I wanted to see his chest, to enjoy the sight of his perfect body. But his body was not mine to enjoy, so I kept my eyes locked with his.</p><p>He broke our connection first by turning and walking to the table. He put something in his pocket, and I dropped my head as he turned around.</p><p>He walked five steps to me; then darkness cloaked my vision. &#x201c;Totally at my mercy,&#x201d; he said in a voice as smooth as the silk scarf covering my eyes. He stroked my breasts. Long fingers took my nipples and rolled them, pulling and twisting.</p><p><i>Fuck. </i></p><p>&#x201c;I thought about bringing out the clamps tonight,&#x201d; he said, flicking the tip of a nipple.</p><p><i>Double fuck. </i></p><p>We had talked about the clamps, though I&#x2019;d never felt or used them. A small bubble of anticipation swelled in my belly. Na�thaniel promised I would like the clamps, that the brief pain would be worth the pleasure they brought.</p><p>&#x201c;Thought about it,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;but decided on something else.&#x201d;</p><p>Cold metal made its way across my chest. It felt like a prickly pizza cutter. He ran it slowly around one breast and then the other. The sensation felt incredible. He didn&#x2019;t go near either nipple. Instead he rolled the wheel closer and closer before mov�ing away. Then there were two, each one mirroring the other in its movements. Teasing and taunting, but never hitting exactly where I needed. Closer and closer they went, then retreated once again. They went even closer on the next pass, and I knew I&#x2019;d combust if he didn&#x2019;t touch me soon.</p><p>And then he did&#x2014;the wheels ran over my nipples right where I needed relief. It felt so good, I forgot where I was, what we were doing, and I moaned out in pleasure.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahhh.&#x201d;</p><p>He immediately pulled back. &#x201c;Damn it, Abigail,&#x201d; he said, taking the scarf from around my eyes. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s twice in less than two hours. Now and earlier in my office.&#x201d; He pulled my hair back so hard I had no choice but to meet his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re mak�ing me believe you don&#x2019;t really want this.&#x201d;</p><p>Tears prickled my eyes. I&#x2019;d wanted so badly to do everything perfectly this weekend. Instead, I&#x2019;d already messed up twice&#x2014; once in his office and once again in his playroom. But the worst, the absolute worst, was knowing I&#x2019;d disappointed Nathaniel.</p><p>I wanted to apologize. To tell him I was sorry and I&#x2019;d do bet�ter. But he&#x2019;d told me not to speak, and the best thing I could do was obey that command.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; he said, still looking me in the eyes. &#x201c;What was the penalty for disobedience during a scene?&#x201d;</p><p>He knew the penalty as well as I did. Probably better. He dragged it out only to make me sweat.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes,&#x201d; he said, as if remembering. &#x201c;Number of strokes for disobedience during a scene is at dom&#x2019;s discretion.&#x201d;</p><p>Dom&#x2019;s discretion.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>What would he decide?</p><p>&#x201c;I could give you twenty.&#x201d; He ran his hands over my backside. &#x201c;But that would end all play for tonight, and I don&#x2019;t think either of us want that.&#x201d;</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>He wouldn&#x2019;t do twenty, would he?</p><p>I dropped my eyes and tried hard not to give in to the temp�tation to look at the whipping bench.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you three earlier in my office, though,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;and they obviously did no good.&#x201d;</p><p>My heart beat through the skin of my chest. I felt certain he saw it as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Eight,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll redo the prior three and add five.&#x201d; He leaned over and whispered, &#x201c;Next time, I&#x2019;ll add five more for a total of thirteen. After that it goes to eighteen.&#x201d; He gave my hair a hard tug. &#x201c;Trust me. You don&#x2019;t want eighteen.&#x201d;</p><p>Hell, no, I didn&#x2019;t want eighteen. I didn&#x2019;t want the eight I had coming.</p><p>He unbuckled my wrists. The tin of salve on the table, ig�nored. There would be no soothing rubdown for now. &#x201c;To the bench, Abigail.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Fuck. </i></p><p><i>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. </i></p><p>I could do this, I told myself as I walked to the bench. <i>We </i>could do this. This was nothing like the last time. He&#x2019;d ex�plained his negligence in the lack of aftercare last time. And there would be only eight strokes tonight.</p><p>I&#x2019;d make damn sure there weren&#x2019;t any more.</p><p>But as bad as last time had been, it wasn&#x2019;t the thought of pain that made my steps slow. It was disappointment in myself. Dis�appointment in my disobedience, but even more so, guilt that my actions forced him to punish me on our first weekend of play. The very first hour of our first weekend.</p><p>I settled my body into the smooth groove of the bench, want�ing it to be over so we could continue on to more enjoyable pur�...</p></p><h2>Zero Waste: Simple Life Hacks to Drastically Reduce Your Trash</h2><p><b>Easy, effective strategies to jumpstart a sustainable, waste-Free lifestyle</b><br><br>We have a worldwide trash epidemic.

Author Sharon E. Wright has written a book that is both useful and inspiring; read this book and you will be able to tie these flies. Every serious fly tier should add <i>Tying Heritage Featherwing Streamers</i> to his library." (<i><i><b>American Angler</b></i> magazine</i> 2014-10-01)<br><br>"Sharon E. Wright has left no stone unturned in her <i>Tying Heritage Featherwing Streamers</i>. The photography is simply breathtaking, the history is a pleasant read that enlightened me, and the list of patterns and tying steps could keep a tier busy forever. I've had the opportunity to meet and get to know many fly tiers over the years with my International Fly Tying Symposium and Fly Fishing Shows. Sharon joined us not long ago and has immediately become a favorite for many attendees. Not only is her tying table like an artist's canvas, colorful and meticulously organized, she loves to share her knowledge of tying. So now Sharon is an author. I'm so happy for her, because her effort in writing her book demonstrates the same attention to detail as her tying, her table displays at the shows, and her rapport with show customers. <i>Tying Heritage Featherwing Streamers</i> is definitely in an elite category of its own and a centerpiece in any person's library." (Chuck Furimsky <i>director, International Fly Tying Symposium</i> 2014-10-01)<br><br>"Sharon E. Wright is one of those rare fly tiers whose precision and perfection at the vice results in pure artistry. Her original featherwing streamer, the Maine Streamer, is a classic design. Wright, an able follower of the late and iconic streamer tier, Carrie Stevens, shares her tying know-how and passion for the Rangeley streamer heritage in her new book, <i>Tying Heritage Featherwing Streamers</i>. The book promises to become a must-have text for any serious tier or follower of the fabled Rangeley Lakes era." (V. Paul Reynolds <i>editor, <i>Northwoods Sporting Journal</i></i> 2014-10-01)<br><br>"<i>Tying Heritage Featherwing Streamers</i> by Sharon E. Wright not only tells the long story of the flies made by Carrie Stevens and her contemporaries; it shows the autopsy of an actual Carrie Stevens fly, establishing once and for all how the flies are made." (Morgan Lyle <i>About.com</i> 2015-01-02)<br><br>"What I take away from the book, though, beyond the dazzle and the innovation, is the solid information about tying techniques. Although it deals with a topic that has a well-defined tradition, this really is a book written 'from a tier's perspective.' If you tie, there are things you can learn here and use, whether you tie featherwing streamers or not."

Food in the novels not only creates character and comedy, but is also a means of highlighting social issues. A grand wedding breakfast skewers ostentation in a wealthy household. A bread-and-butter tea conjures honesty and companionship. The gruel given to hungry children exposes a cruel and unjust regime.<br> <br>The characters who throng Dickens novels are forever offering one another punch or seed biscuits; arranging a nice little supper of pickled salmon, salad and tea; showing concern with a roast fowl; or sisterly love with a painstakingly made beefsteak pudding. And, of course, there is the great feast of Christmas, celebrated in glorious style even by the impoverished Cratchits. At home, Dickens&#x2019; wife Catherine helped him entertain, and published (under a pseudonym) her own book, <i>What Shall We Have for Dinner?</i>, with pages of menus or &#x201c;bills of fare&#x201d; for different sizes of party and the changing seasons.<br> <br>In <i>Dinner with Dickens</i>, Pen Vogler has fully updated recipes from contemporary Victorian cookbooks, including Catherine&#x2019;s own book.

A professor introduces her middle-aged son to a favorite student, unaware of the student&#x2019;s true affections. A lifelong bachelor finds kinship with a man wrongly accused of an indiscretion. Six women establish a private investigating agency to battle extramarital affairs in Beijing. Written in lyrical prose and with stunning honesty, <i>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl </i>introduces us to worlds strange and familiar, creating a mesmerizing and vibrant landscape of life.<br></p></p><p><strong>Yiyun Li on <em>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</em></strong> <p>A childhood memory that my sister and I shared, though from slightly different angles, was a lost two-yuan bill. She was seven, and I was three, and on this summer day she was in charge of taking care of me and buying two yuan worth of pork, which, in 1976, would count as half of our monthly meat ration.</p> <p>The waiting line at the meat counter was long. I was hot, and bored, and made a fuss to hold the bill for my sister while she struggled not to lose the ration book, or me, or her position in the line. She had me promise not to let the money go from my grasp many times before putting it in my hand; I walked in and out of the line, holding the money tightly, but the next thing I knew, when I looked again the money was gone from my hand, and in its place I had a piece of scrap paper.</p> <p>My sister received a memorable beating for the lost bill from our mother. I received no such punishment, but had my first experience of remorse. For days after I would try to revise my memory: that I had not asked for the money; that I had held it so securely that it had not been replaced. But remorse, like my sister's pains from the beating or from being the less favored daughter, takes its course to become less engrossing, so the episode becomes a joke between us, standing in for all the things we can and cannot possibly laugh about. What I find more fascinating, though, is how the money was replaced: my parents believed that I dropped the money and picked up something else in its place; I, however, knowing even then the significance of two-yuan bill, believed that I had not let the money go until someone, not by force but by guile, got the money out of my hand and repaid me with the scrap paper. Either possibility would make sense; either could make a story with a happy ending: the one who deceived a small child and the one who spotted a lost bill could both, at the end of the day, celebrate their good fortune.</p> <p>All the stories in <em>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</em>, like the episode with the lost money, came from situations--both Chinese and American--that could lead to different stories. The versions I chose to tell, I hope, have neither villains nor victims in them but people who have both taken from others and have been taken from, who have both deceived and been deceived, and who are as lonely as you and I.</p> <p>�2010 by Yiyun Li</p><b>Yiyun Li</b> is the author of four works of fiction&#x2014;<i>Kinder Than Solitude</i>, <i>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</i>, <i>The Vagrants</i>, and <i>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</i>&#x2014;and the memoir <i>Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life</i>.

They provide a "practical theology" for emerging adult ministry and offer insight into the key developmental issues of this stage of life, including identity, intimacy and sexuality, morality, church involvement, spiritual formation, vocation, and mentoring.

Saying yes takes Wallace into a new plane of existence: a place where money comes as easily as it goes, nodding a lot can lead to a long weekend overseas with new friends, and romance isn't as complicated as it seems.

He is twenty-seven and lives in an old match factory in London.<b>Chapter 1: In Which the Story Begins</b> <p> <b>It is quite incredible how a bus -- a simple, red, London bus -- can change your life.</b> </p><p> There were other reasons for why what happened eventually happened, of course. I'm not saying it was all about the bus. But the bus was pretty high on the list. Or, more accurately, the man sitting next to me on the bus. Here he is, right now, flicking through his <i>Evening Standard,</i> checking his cheap, black watch, mere moments after uttering a sentence that, quite without him knowing, has had the most unexpected effect on me. </p><p> It's like one of those moments in a cartoon, when a second of complete and total revelation hits an unenlightened fool, a moment in which they're bathed in a golden light from the heavens above; their face a picture of comfort; the only sound the chorus of a thousand angels. </p><p> Of course, real life isn't quite like that. I'm on a crowded bus in the East End of London, for a start, and so the only thing I'm bathed in is an unpleasant mist of sweat and coughs. </p><p> But it's still an epiphany. And I'm still smiling from what I've heard, smiling from what I've learned. I start to wonder whether anyone else is feeling the same. So I sneak a chance to glance around. To see if one of my fellow passengers has been struck by the man's simple message; his message of hope and optimism and all the things I hadn't realised I'd been losing sight of. </p><p> But no one has. Not that I can see, anyway. That's okay, though. There's time for them. </p><p> Because this man next to me...this man has changed <i>everything.</i> </p><p> "Maybe it was Jesus," said Ian, putting his pint down on the table. We were in the Yorkshire Grey, and Ian was a bit drunk. "Or maybe it was Buddha! I'd love to meet Buddha. He looks like a right laugh. What did this bloke look like? If he had a beard, it was probably Jesus, and if he had a belly, it was probably Buddha." </p><p> "He had a beard, but it wasn't a Jesus beard." </p><p> "A belly, then?" he said with what looked like real hope in his eyes. "Did he have a Buddha belly?" </p><p> "I'm fairly sure he wasn't Buddha, either. This was an Indian bloke. His name was Medhi, or something." </p><p> "'Medhi' sounds a bit like 'Jesus.'" </p><p> "No, it doesn't. And it wasn't Jesus. What would Jesus be doing in Bethnal Green?" </p><p> "There are some nice pound shops in Bethnal Green." </p><p> "Jesus is the son of God, Ian, he doesn't need discount shops." </p><p> "Cor, imagine the pocket money you'd get if you were the son of God." </p><p> "Ian...I'm trying to tell you about my life-changing moment, and you're going on about Jesus in a pound shop." </p><p> "Sorry, go on. So there was this bloke on a bus last week, who wasn't a deity or a son of God, and then there was also your diary?" </p><p> Yes. There was also my diary. High up on the list, right under the bus, was my diary. A diary I had only started because I was afraid I would forget all the wonderful things I was doing. All the dazzling, crazy, hazy times. The important times, the carefree times, the times I'd look back on as the times of my life. Only when I flicked through it did I realise there was nothing to forget. Or, rather, nothing worth remembering. </p><p> Things had been different last year. Last year was a year of adventure. Of fun. Of friends. Six months into a new year I'd slowly begun to realise that all my stories were about last year. All my memories, too. I'd been cruising on past glories, dining out on better times. Well, that's not strictly true. Not true at all. I'd been dining in on them. </p><p> For a number of months I'd been labouring under the impression that everything in my life was fine. I was a single man in his midtwenties, living in one of the most exciting cities in the world. Turns out I was a single man in his pants, sitting in his flat. </p><p> It had happened to me once before, this strange sense of midtwenties crisis, but it had happened when I'd lacked direction. These days I had direction. Plenty of it. But the direction was down. </p><p> In my mind I was one of London's young, thrusting urbanites. In my mind I was always on the go, always had somewhere to be, always in the thick of things. I thought I was like something out of an advert. I probably even thought I had a moped. </p><p> I couldn't have been more wrong. Especially about the moped. </p><p> And this is what I would finally realise after I got home from talking to the man on the bus. </p><p> I'd ended up talking to the man on the bus quite by chance. </p><p> It was, until that moment, just another day working in the West End, followed by just another dash to the Tube station in what was just another hopeless attempt to beat the rush hour and get home without spending an hour on a crowded train with my cheeks pressed up against a stranger's nipples, receiving severe paper cuts every time they turned a page of their book. </p><p> We'd been standing, me and this man, waiting for the Central Line train to take us from Holborn to the East End, when the announcement had spluttered and stuttered its way over the tannoy. It was a security alert. We were being asked to leave. Our journeys home had just gained an hour. We'd be shunted and squeezed onto buses outside and driven home, very slowly during rush hour, on a rainy, rainy London night. </p><p> The man and I had raised our eyebrows at each other and smiled in a "what's the world coming to" way, but other than that we didn't say a word to each other. We'd simply started to walk up the stairs and out of the station, like the good, old-fashioned, obedient British citizens we were. </p><p> "Nice weather for this!" said the man as we jogged through a slanting rain and flashed our travel cards at the bus driver. I ha-ha'ed, probably a little too ha-hard, and we joined the seething masses on board the bus. </p><p> After ten minutes and three stops, we found seats for ourselves, and after another ten, we had begun to chat. </p><p> "Where are you headed?" I'd asked. </p><p> "Aldgate," he'd replied. </p><p> The man, as it turned out, was a teacher. </p><p> And he was about to teach me. </p><p> "So, what did he teach you?" said Ian. </p><p> "I'll tell you in a minute." </p><p> "Tell me now. I want to know what kind of wisdom he imparted on you that's caused you to summon me here." </p><p> "I didn't 'summon' you here." </p><p> "You sent me an e-mail saying that your entire life had changed and that you wanted to meet up." </p><p> "That's hardly summoning. I was more saying 'Do you fancy a pint?'" </p><p> "Great. I do. Thanks." </p><p> I sighed, stood up, and went to get us a round. </p><p> Now that I think about it, my downward spiral had probably started after I'd been dumped by my girlfriend last autumn. It was a shock to the system, a body blow that had really changed things. </p><p> But don't go thinking I'm all hung up on an ex-girlfriend. This isn't one of those stories of obsession and regret and of trying to get back together. I've never been someone who would have made an effective stalker, for one thing, lacking as I do both the necessary energies and a decent pair of binoculars. </p><p> It's just that being dumped suddenly puts time into perspective. I'm not saying my three years with Hanne were wasted, because they weren't; they were great and warm and loving. I'm just saying that at the end of any relationship you take a long, hard look at the years that have gone by and say "What now?" </p><p> So I did three years of growing up in two weeks. I returned to the world of freelance employment as a radio producer at the BBC. I got a mortgage. And a pension. I started to shop at Habitat and IKEA. I experimented with new and exciting pastas. I bought a colander and some air freshener and a fountain pen. I learned how to iron. I even bought a plant. </p><p> Most of these were small changes. But soon, quite without my knowing, I developed a certain satisfaction for staying in. For pottering about and tinkering with things. For slouching, and napping, and channel hopping. Soon that was all I wanted to do. And so I became the man who could wriggle out of any prior engagement. Who could spot an invitation coming a mile away and head it off at the pass. The man who'd gladly swap a night down the pub for just one whiff of an episode of EastEnders. The man who'd send an e-mail instead of attend a birthday. Who'd text instead of call, and call instead of visit. I became the man who'd mastered the white lie. The man who always had an excuse. The man who always said no. </p><p> And I was perfectly happy. Perfectly happy to be me, myself, and ironing. Perfectly happy until that night on that bus, next to that man. </p><p> "Okay. So, there was a man," said Ian. "And you sat next to him. So far this isn't really what you'd call a classic anecdote." </p><p> "But it's what he told me that was important, Ian." </p><p> "Yes, it sounds it. But <i>what</i> did he say? What was it that he actually said that changed things? Because right now all I know is that a man said something to you." </p><p> "Have patience." </p><p> "He said, 'Have patience'?" </p><p> "No, that's what I said, just then. What he said was more important." </p><p> "But what <i>was</i> it?" </p><p> It was my friends who'd noticed it first. They'd noticed I'd changed, or that I just wasn't around as much as I was, or that I was just saying no a lot more often. </p><p> There were the odd nights down at the pub, of course, and I always agreed that we should do it more often, but it just never seemed to be the right night. I was too tired, or there was something I wanted to watch, or I just felt like being alone. I couldn't put my finger on it. The weird thing was, it didn't make me sad. Not while it was happening, anyway. It only made me sad when I finally realised the effect it was having on my friendships; on the friends I was letting down or annoying or disappointing or even losing. </p><p> But at the time I just didn't notice it. The sad fact is, saying no had become a habit. </p><p> "Aha! I knew it!" said Ian, pointing his finger slightly too close to my face. "I knew you were always making excuses!" </p><p> "I know. And I'm sorry." </p><p> "That night when you said you couldn't come out because you'd won a competition to meet Lionel Richie, was that an excuse?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "How about that time you couldn't co...</p></p><h2>Reviving Your Sex Life After Childbirth: Your Guide to Pain-free and Pleasurable Sex After the Baby</h2><p>Reviving Your Sex Life After Childbirth helps post-partum women restore pain-free and pleasurable sex after childbirth.

A rich and illuminating book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Thomas Nagel, <i>New York Review of Books</i></p><p>Idealization is a fundamental feature of human thought. We build simplified models to make sense of the world, and life is a constant adjustment between the models we make and the realities we encounter. Our beliefs, desires, and sense of justice are bound up with these ideals, and we proceed &#x201c;as if&#x201d; our representations were true, while knowing they are not. In this elegant and original meditation, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests that this instinct to idealize is not dangerous or distracting so much as it is necessary. <i>As If</i> explores how strategic untruth plays a critical role in far-flung areas of inquiry: decision theory, psychology, natural science, and political philosophy. A polymath who writes with mainstream clarity, Appiah defends the centrality of the imagination not just in the arts but in science, morality, and everyday life.</p><p>&#x201c;Appiah is the rare public intellectual who is also a first-rate analytic philosopher, and the characteristic virtues associated with each of these identities are very much in evidence throughout the book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Thomas Kelly, <i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i></p></p><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah writes the Ethicist column for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.

Commentaries on Atisha&#39;s Seven Points of Mind Training</h2><p>Osho is known around the world for his pioneering contribution to meditation &#x2014; the science of inner transformation &#x2014; with the unique approach of his "Osho Active Meditations" acknowledging the accelerated pace of the contemporary world and bringing meditation into modern life. Based on the <i>Seven Points of Mind Training</i> by the 11th-century Buddhist mystic Atisa, <i>The Book of Wisdom</i> removes the dust of tradition that has gathered around meditation, conveying the essential science and methodology of the practice with a freshness and spontaneity that is rarely found in contemporary spiritual works. The book is a guide for inner discipline and transformation that is also highly accessible, incorporating light, often humorous question-and-answer sessions between the author and his audience that help readers make the practical connection between spiritual theory and meditation as a lifestyle.</p><p>&#34;The seven points . . . are like seeds, they contain much. The moment you move into the statements deeply, when you contemplate and meditate and start experimenting with them, you will be surprised-you will be going into the greatest adventure of your life.&#34;Readers unfamiliar with Osho may remember him by his earlier name, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, and by the image of him grinning from behind the window of one of his many Rolls-Royces at the ashram he founded in Oregon. Controversy and legal problems led him to return to his native India and eventually to change his name to Osho. The author died in 1990, but his followers carry on his teachings and continue to publish his voluminous writings. This book takes the Seven Points of Mind Training by Atisha, an 11th-century Tibetan mystic, as the starting point for Osho's reflections. The title is misleading, since the text and the question-and-answer sessions have more to do with Osho's own point of view than Tibetan Buddhism, and his is, at times, a very eccentric perspective. Mixed in with some fairly standard insights into spiritual practice are overt criticisms of many religious traditions and their followers as well as a peculiar penchant for jokes, many of them off-color. It seems the title is designed to cash in on the current interest in Tibetan Buddhism, and it would be a shame if it distracts the curious from the many worthy titles on the subject currently available.

He digs into the war&#x2019;s major events and reveals the unknown, bizarre, and often wildly amusing things the participants were doing while breaking away from Great Britain.<br><br>For example, conventional wisdom says that no taxation without representation&#x201d; was an important reason for the revolution, but not in the way we&#x2019;ve been told. Colonists paid the wages of common-court judges, who were reluctant to rule against the men who paid their salaries. Therefore, duties on molasses (the key ingredient in rum) were generally unenforced until the British cut the tariff in half. Strange but true, the spark that touched off the revolution was in fact a tax <i>cut</i>.<br><br>During the French and Indian War and then again in the first year of the revolution, the British were accused of biological warfare, infecting blankets with smallpox and then concealing them in Indian camps. So feared was the disease that soldiers began to illegally inoculate themselves before widespread vaccination was finally ordered for the army. Washington himself was immune, thanks to a Caribbean trip taken as a young man when his brother Lawrence sought a cure for tuberculosis. Lawrence wasn&#x2019;t cured, but George was infected with smallpox in Barbados. As a young man in a warm climate, he survived.

There is a last time for everything, he thought with dignity as a holographic image sprang into being above his desk. He&#x2019;d studied the image of that armed and armored Big Ugly a great many times indeed in the sixty years&#x2014;thirty of this planet&#x2019;s slow revolutions around its star&#x2014;since coming to Tosev 3.<br><br>The Tosevite rode a beast with a mane and a long, flowing tail. He wore chainmail that needed a good scouring to get rid of the rust. His chief weapon was an iron-tipped spear. The spearhead also showed tiny flecks of rust, and some not so tiny. To protect himself against similarly armed enemies, the Tosevite carried a shield with a red cross painted on it.<br><br>Another poke of the fingerclaw made the hologram disappear. Atvar&#x2019;s mouth fell open in an ironic laugh. The Race had expected to face that kind of opposition when it sent its conquest fleet from Home to Tosev 3. Why not? It had all seemed so reasonable. The probe had shown no high technology anywhere on the planet, and the conquest fleet was only sixteen hundred years behind&#x2014;eight hundred years here. How much could technology change in eight hundred years?<br><br>Back on Home, not much. Here . . . Here, when the conquest fleet arrived, the Big Uglies had been fighting an immense war among themselves, fighting not with spears and beasts and chainmail but with machine guns, with cannon-carrying landcruisers, with killercraft that spat death from the air, with radio and telephones. They&#x2019;d been working on guided missiles and on nuclear weapons.<br><br>And so, despite battles bigger and fiercer than anyone back on Home could have imagined, the conquest fleet hadn&#x2019;t quite conquered. More than half the land area of Tosev 3 had come under its control, but several not-empires&#x2014;a notion of government that still seemed strange to Atvar&#x2014;full of Big Uglies (and, not coincidentally, full of nuclear weapons) remained independent. Atvar couldn&#x2019;t afford to wreck the planet to beat the Tosevites into submission, not with the colonization fleet on the way and only twenty local years behind the fleet he commanded. The colonists had to have somewhere to settle.<br><br>He&#x2019;d never expected to need to learn to be a diplomat. Being diplomatic with the obstreperous Big Uglies wasn&#x2019;t easy. Being diplomatic with the males and females of the conquest fleet had often proved even harder. They&#x2019;d expected everything to be waiting for them and in good order when they arrived. They&#x2019;d expected a conquered planet full of submissive primitives. They&#x2019;d been loudly and unhappily surprised when they didn&#x2019;t get one. Here ten local years after their arrival, a lot of them still were.<br><br>Atvar&#x2019;s unhappy musings&#x2014;and had he had any other kind since coming to Tosev 3?&#x2014;cut off when his adjutant walked into the room. Pshing&#x2019;s body paint, like that of any adjutant, was highly distinctive. On one side, it showed his own not particularly high rank. On the other, it matched the body paint of his principal&#x2014;and Atvar&#x2019;s pattern, as befit his rank, was the most ornate and elaborate on Tosev 3.<br><br>Pshing bent into the posture of respect. Even his tailstump twitched to one side. &#x201c;I greet you, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; he said in the hissing, popping language of the Race.<br><br>&#x201c;And I greet you,&#x201d; Atvar replied.<br><br>Straightening, Pshing said, &#x201c;They are waiting for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course they are,&#x201d; Atvar said bitterly. &#x201c;Eaters of carrion always gather to feast at a juicy corpse.&#x201d; His tailstump quivered in anger.<br><br>&#x201c;I am sorry, Exalted Fleetlord.&#x201d; Pshing had the courtesy to sound as if he meant it. &#x201c;But when the recall order came from Home, what could you do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could obey, or I could rebel,&#x201d; Atvar answered. His adjutant hissed in horror at the very idea. Among the Race, even saying such things was shocking. There had been mutinies and rebellions here on Tosev 3. Perhaps more than anything else, that told what sort of place this was. Atvar held up a placating hand. &#x201c;I obey. I will go into cold sleep. I will return to Home. Maybe by the time I get there, those who will sit in judgment on me will have learned more. Our signals, after all, travel twice as fast as our starships.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Truth, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; Pshing said. &#x201c;Meanwhile, though, as I told you, those who wish to say farewell await you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know they do.&#x201d; Atvar waggled his lower jaw back and forth as he laughed, to show he was not altogether amused. &#x201c;Some few, perhaps, will be glad to see me. The rest will be glad to see me&#x2014;go.&#x201d; He got to his feet and sardonically made as if to assume the posture of respect before Pshing. &#x201c;Lead on. I follow. Why not? It is a pleasant day.&#x201d;<br><br>The fleetlord even meant that. Few places on Tosev 3 fully suited the Race; most of this world was cold and damp compared to Home. But the city called Cairo was perfectly temperate, especially in summertime. Pshing held the door open for Atvar. Only the great size of that door, like the height of the ceiling, reminded Atvar that Big Uglies had built the place once called Shepheard&#x2019;s Hotel. As the heart of the Race&#x2019;s rule on Tosev 3, it had been extensively modified year after year. It would not have made a first-class establishment back on Home, perhaps, but it would have been a decent enough second-class place.<br><br>When Atvar strode into the meeting hall, the males and females gathered there all assumed the posture of respect&#x2014;all save Fleetlord Reffet, the commander of the colonization fleet, the only male in the room whose body paint matched Atvar&#x2019;s in complexity. Reffet confined himself to a civil nod. Civility was as much as Atvar had ever got from him. He&#x2019;d usually had worse, for Reffet had never stopped blaming him for not presenting Tosev 3 to the colonists neatly wrapped up and decorated.<br><br>To Atvar&#x2019;s surprise, a handful of tall, erect Tosevites towered over the males and females of the Race. Because they did not slope forward from the hips and because they had no tailstumps, their version of the posture of respect was a clumsy makeshift. Their pale, soft skins and the cloth wrappings they wore stood out against the clean simplicity of green-brown scales and body paint.<br><br>&#x201c;Did we have to have Big Uglies here?&#x201d; Atvar asked. &#x201c;If it were not for the trouble the Big Uglies caused us, I would not be going Home now.&#x201d; I would be Atvar the Conqueror, remembered in history forever. I will be remembered in history, all right, but not the way I had in mind before I set out with the conquest fleet.<br><br>&#x201c;When some of them asked to attend, Exalted Fleetlord, it was difficult to say no,&#x201d; Pshing replied. &#x201c;That one there, for instance&#x2014;the one with the khaki wrappings and the white fur on his head&#x2014;is Sam Yeager.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Atvar used the affirmative hand gesture. &#x201c;Well, you are right. If he wanted to be here, you could not very well have excluded him. Despite his looks, he might as well be a member of the Race himself. He has done more for us than most of the males and females in this room. Without him, we probably would have fought the war that annihilated the planet.&#x201d;<br><br>He strode through the crowd toward the Big Ugly, ignoring his own kind. No doubt they would talk about his bad manners later. Since this was his last appearance on Tosev 3, he didn&#x2019;t care. He would do as he pleased, not as convention dictated. &#x201c;I greet you, Sam Yeager,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;And I greet you, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; Yeager replied in the language of the Race. His accent was mushy, as a Big Ugly&#x2019;s had to be. But the rhythms of his speech could almost have come from Home. More than any other Tosevite, he thought like a male of the Race. &#x201c;I wish you good fortune in your return. And I also want you to know how jealous I am of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of me? By the Emperor, why?&#x201d; When Atvar spoke of his sovereign, he swung his eye turrets so he looked down to the ground as a token of respect and reverence. He hardly even knew he did it; such habits had been ingrained in him since hatchlinghood.<br><br>&#x201c;Why? Because you are going Home, and I wish I could see your world.&#x201d;<br><br>Atvar laughed. &#x201c;Believe me, Sam Yeager, some things are better wished for than actually obtained.&#x201d; Would he have said that to one of his own species? Probably not. It somehow seemed less a betrayal and more a simple truth when told to a Tosevite.<br><br>Yeager made the affirmative gesture, though it was not one Big Uglies used among themselves. &#x201c;That is often true. I am jealous even so,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Exalted Fleetlord, may I present to you my hatchling, Jonathan Yeager, and his mate, Karen Yeager?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am pleased to meet you,&#x201d; Atvar said politely.<br><br>Both of the other Big Uglies assumed the posture of respect. &#x201c;We greet you, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; they said together in the Race&#x2019;s language. The female&#x2019;s voice was higher and shriller than the male&#x2019;s. Her head fur was a coppery color. Jonathan Yeager cut off all the fur on his head except for the two strips above his small, immobile eyes; Big Uglies used those as signaling devices. Many younger Tosevites removed their head fur in an effort to seem more like members of the Race. Little by little, assimilation progressed.<br><br>On Tosev 3, though, assimilation was a two-way street. In colder parts of the planet, males and females of the Race wore Tosevite-style cloth wrappings to protect themselves from the ghastly weather. And, thanks to the unfortunate effects of the herb called ginger, the Race&#x2019;s patterns of sexuality here had to some degree begun to resemble the Big Uglies&#x2019; constant and revolting randiness. Atvar sighed. Without ginger, his life would have been simpler. Without Tosev 3, my life would have been simpler, he thought glumly.<br><br>&#x201c;Please excuse me,&#x201d; he told the Yeagers, and went off to greet another Tosevite, the foreign minister&#x2014;foreign commissar was the term the not-empire preferred&#x2014;of the SSSR. The male called Gromyko had features almost as immobile as if he belonged to the Race.<br><br>He spoke in his own language. A Tosevite interpreter said, &#x201c;He wishes you good fortune on your return to your native world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thank you,&#x201d; Atvar said, directly to the Tosevite diplomat. Gromyko understood the language of the Race, even if he seldom chose to use it. His head bobbed up and down, his equivalent of the affirmative gesture.<br><br>Shiplord Kirel came up to Atvar. Kirel had commanded the 127th Emperor Hetto, the bannership of the conquest fleet. &#x201c;I am glad you are able to go Home, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but this recall is undeserved. You have done everything in your power to bring this world into the Empire.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We both know that,&#x201d; Atvar replied. &#x201c;Back on Home, what do they know? Signals take eleven local years to get there, and another eleven to get back. And yet they think they can manage events here from there. Absurd!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They do it on the other two conquered planets,&#x201d; Kirel said.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course they do.&#x201d; Atvar scornfully wiggled an eye turret. &#x201c;With the Rabotevs and the Hallessi, nothing ever happens.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeing that Ttomalss, the Race&#x2019;s leading expert on Big Uglies, was at the reception, Atvar went over to him. &#x201c;I greet you, Exalted Fleetlord,&#x201d; the senior psychologist said. &#x201c;It is a pleasure to find Sam Yeager at your reception.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is your corresponding fingerclaw on the other hand, is he not?&#x201d; Atvar said, and Ttomalss made the affirmative gesture. The fleetlord asked, &#x201c;And how is Kassquit these days?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She is well. Thank you for inquiring,&#x201d; Ttomalss answered. &#x201c;She still presents a fascinating study on the interaction of genetic and cultural inheritances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Atvar said. &#x201c;I wonder what she would make of Home. A pity no one has yet developed cold-sleep techniques for the Tosevite metabolism. As for me, I almost welcome the oblivion cold sleep will bring. The only pity is that I will have to awaken to face the uncomprehending fools I am bound to meet on my return.&#x201d;<br>Sam Yeager looked at the doctor across the desk from him. Jerry Kleinfeldt, who couldn&#x2019;t have been above half his age, looked back with the cocksure certainty medical men all seemed to wear these days. It wasn&#x2019;t like that when I was a kid, Yeager thought. It wasn&#x2019;t just that he&#x2019;d almost died as an eleven-year-old in the influenza epidemic of 1918. Back then, you could die of any number of things that were casually treatable now. Doctors had known it, too, and shown a little humility. Humility, though, had gone out of style with the shingle bob and the Charleston.<br><br>Kleinfeldt condescended to glance down at the papers on his desk. &#x201c;Well, Colonel Yeager, I have to tell you, you&#x2019;re in damn good shape for a man of seventy. Your blood pressure&#x2019;s no higher than mine, no sign of malignancy, nothing that would obviously keep you from trying this, if you&#x2019;re bound and determined to do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I am, all right,&#x201d; Sam Yeager said. &#x201c;Being who you are, being what you are, you&#x2019;ll understand why, too, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who, me?&#x201d; When Dr. Kleinfeldt grinned, it made him look even more like a kid than he did already&#x2014;which, to Yeager&#x2019;s jaundiced eye, was quite a bit. The fluorescent lights overhead gleamed off his shaven scalp. Given what he specialized in, was it surprising he&#x2019;d ape the Lizards as much as a mere human being could?<br><br>But suddenly, Sam had no patience for joking questions or grins. &#x201c;Cut the crap,&#x201d; he said, his voice harsh. &#x201c;We both know that if the government gave a good goddamn about me, they wouldn&#x2019;t let me be a guinea pig. But they&#x2019;re glad to let me give it a try, and they halfway hope it doesn&#x2019;t work. More than halfway, or I miss my guess.&#x201d;<br><br>Kleinfeldt steepled his fingers. Now he looked steadily back at Sam. The older man realized that, despite his youth, despite the foolishness he affected, the doctor was highly capable. He wouldn&#x2019;t have been involved with this project if he weren&#x2019;t. Picking his words with care, he said, &#x201c;You exaggerate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I?&#x201d; Yeager said. &#x201c;How much?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some,&#x201d; Kleinfeldt answered judiciously. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the man who knows as much about the Race as any human living. And you&#x2019;re the man who can think like a Lizard, which isn&#x2019;t the same thing at all. Having you along when this mission eventually gets off the ground&#x2014;and eventually is the operative word here&#x2014;would be an asset.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there are a lot of people in high places who think having me dead would be an asset, too,&#x201d; Sam said.<br><br>&#x201c;Not to the point of doing anything drastic&#x2014;or that&#x2019;s my reading of it, anyhow,&#x201d; Dr. Kleinfeldt said. &#x201c;Besides, even if everything works just the way it&#x2019;s supposed to, you&#x2019;d be, ah, effectively dead, you might say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On ice, I&#x2019;d call it,&#x201d; Yeager said, and Dr. Kleinfeldt nodded. With a wry chuckle, Sam added, &#x201c;Four or five years ago, at Fleetlord Atvar&#x2019;s farewell reception, I told him I was jealous that he was going back to Home and I couldn&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t realize we&#x2019;d come as far as we have on cold sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you see him there, maybe you can tell him so.&#x201d; Kleinfeldt looked down at the papers on his desk again, then back to Sam. &#x201c;You mean we own a secret or two you haven&#x2019;t managed to dig up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck you, Doc,&#x201d; Sam said evenly. Kleinfeldt blinked. How many years had it been since somebody came right out and said that to him? Too many, by all the signs. Yeager went on, &#x201c;See, this is the kind of stuff I get from just about everybody.&#x201d;<br><br>After another pause for thought, Dr. Kleinfeldt said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to level with you, Colonel: a lot of people think you&#x2019;ve earned it.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam nodded. He knew that. He couldn&#x2019;t help knowing it. Because of what he&#x2019;d done, Indianapolis had gone up in radioactive fire and a president of the United States had killed himself. The hardest part was, he couldn&#x2019;t make himself feel guilty about it. Bad, yes. Guilty? No. There was a difference. He wondered if he could make Kleinfeldt understand. Worth a try, maybe: &#x201c;What we did ...</p><h2>The Crown&#39;s Game (Crown&#39;s Game, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>"Gorgeous and richly imagined."&#x2014;Sara Raasch, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the Snow Like Ashes series</strong></p><p><strong>"Teeming with hidden magic and fiery romance."&#x2014;Sabaa Tahir, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>An Ember in the Ashes</em></strong></p><p>Perfect for fans of <em>Shadow and Bone</em> and <em>Red Queen</em>, <em>The Crown&#x2019;s Game</em> is a thrilling and atmospheric historical fantasy set in Imperial Russia about two teenagers who must compete for the right to become the Imperial Enchanter&#x2014;or die in the process&#x2014;from debut author Evelyn Skye.</p><p>Vika Andreyeva can summon the snow and turn ash into gold.

But this year, Patricia's job as a social worker will lead her to a very special five-year-old. Against her better judgment, Patricia bends the rules and takes the little girl to her own home. Through the presence of Emily in their house, and her penetrating questions about heaven, the Addisons learn that there is no sorrow so great that faith cannot help you find your way through. And Christmas will once more be a time of joy in their home. THE CHRISTMAS HOPE is a story of love in the face of loss, joy when all seems hopeless, and how light can shine into the darkest places.</p></p><p><p><b>Donna VanLiere</b> is a <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author.

She is a gifted speaker who speaks regularly at conferences. She lives in Franklin, Tennessee, with her husband and their children.</p>Donna VanLiere does a superior job dramatizing her story in THE CHRISTMAS HOPE. She is professional, but her Midwestern and Southern roots slip into her delivery from time to time (mostly in the thoughts of the female lead character), adding background to the characterization. Her writing isn't as good as her acting--the plot is predictable, the story unfolds slowly, and a number of the phrases are clich�d. But the core story of a child healing a broken family at Christmas is still heartwarming, and she has a fine eye for realistic detail in her descriptions. Sentimental listeners will enjoy evident VanLiere's affection for her characters.

Wharton broke the conventions of woman's romantic fiction by making Charity a thoroughly contemporary woman--in touch with her feelings and sexuality, yet kept from love and the larger world she craves by the overwhelming pressures of environment and heredity. Praised for its realism and candor by such writers as Joseph Conrad and Henry James and compared to Flaubert's <i>Madame Bovary</i>, <i>Summer</i> was one of Wharton's personal favorites of all her novels and remains as fresh and relevant today as when it was first written.The upper stratum of New York society into which Edith Wharton was born in 1862 provided her with an abundance of material as a novelist but did not encourage her growth as an artist. Educated by tutors and governesses, she was raised for only one career: marriage. But her marriage, in 1885, to Edward Wharton was an emotional disappointment, if not a disaster. She suffered the first of a series of nervous breakdowns in 1894. In spite of the strain of her marriage, or perhaps because of it, she began to write fiction and published her first story in 1889.<br><br>Her first published book was a guide to interior decorating, but this was followed by several novels and story collections. They were written while the Whartons lived in Newport and New York, traveled in Europe, and built their grand home, The Mount, in Lenox, Massachusetts. In Europe, she met Henry James, who became her good friend, traveling companion, and the sternest but most careful critic of her fiction. <b>The House of Mirth </b>(1905) was both a resounding critical success and a bestseller, as was <b>Ethan Frome </b>(1911). In 1913 the Whartons were divorced, and Edith took up permanent residence in France. Her subject, however, remained America, especially the moneyed New York of her youth. Her great satiric novel, <b>The Custom of the Country </b>was published in 1913 and <b>The Age of Innocence</b> won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. <br><br>In her later years, she enjoyed the admiration of a new generation of writers, including Sinclair Lewis and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In all, she wrote some thirty books, including an autobiography. <i> A Backwards Glance</i> (1934). She died at her villa near Paris in 1937.</p><h2>Calvin&#39;s New Testament Commentaries, Volume 8: Romans and Thessalonians</h2><p>The power of John Calvin&#39;s study of Romans and of 1 and 2 Thessalonians is captured in this superb translation by R.

John Calvin was born in Noyon, France on July 10, 1509. His father was the secretary and attorney for the bishopric of Noyon. Calvin was a brilliant scholar and studied law in Paris, Orleans and Bourges. After what he called a &#34;sudden conversion&#34; at the age of 23, Calvin became a fervent Christian and scholar of the Scripture. Calvin did not immediately break with the Roman Catholic Church, but rather worked toward its reform. His pleas for reform soon brought upon him the hatred of the Catholic Church, and in time he was banished from Paris. Calvin fled to Switzerland, broke with the Catholic Church, and joined with the reformers. In 1536 he published his famous Institutes of the Christian Religion, which was a systematic presentation of the Protestant position. In 1559 he founded what later became the University of Geneva. Here he taught his beliefs to thousands of students who in turn carried &#34;Calvinism&#34; back to their homelands throughout Europe. John Calvin died in Geneva, Switzerland on May 27, 1564.</p><h2>Honored Enemy (Legends of the Riftwar, Book 1)</h2><p><p>In the frozen northlands of the embattled realm of Midkemia, fate can form strange alliances.</p><p>It is nine long, bloody years into the ongoing Riftwar that is tearing Midkemia asunder.

In a rapidly changing world faced with seemingly impossible problems, it becomes important to understand that each person has something to contribute. Both timely and timeless, this book combines dramatic real life experiences with compelling mythic tales and a profound exploration of the wisdom of genius, and is essential for anyone who seeks to awaken their own genius and learn how to heal nature and renew culture. Rather than a heroic journey undertaken by a select few, the genius myth imagines that everyone by virtue of bearing some genius qualities is subject to a genuine calling in life. The question becomes not whether or not you are a genius, but in what way does genius appear in you and how might it contribute to your well-being and at the same time benefit the world around you. This book will help young people hoping to find a meaningful way in the world and adults wanting to dwell more deeply in life. It offers essential ideas for parents and teachers, counselors and mentors seeking to encourage and support those they teach and care about.

Rather than share this information with her, they withheld the diagnosis in order to &#x201c;protect&#x201d; the development of her gender identity; it was years before Davis would see her own medical records as an adult and learn the truth. Davis&#x2019; experience is not unusual. Many intersex people feel isolated from one another and violated by medical practices that support conventional notions of the male/female sex binary which have historically led to secrecy and shame about being intersex. Yet, the rise of intersex activism and visibility in the US has called into question the practice of classifying intersex as an abnormality, rather than as a mere biological variation. This shift in thinking has the potential to transform entrenched intersex medical treatment.</p><br><p>In Contesting Intersex, Davis draws on interviews with intersex people, their parents, and medical experts to explore the oft-questioned views on intersex in medical and activist communities, as well as the evolution of thought in regards to intersex visibility and transparency. She finds that framing intersex as an abnormality is harmful and can alter the course of one&#x2019;s life. In fact, controversy over this framing continues, as intersex has been renamed a &#x2018;disorder of sex development&#x2019; throughout medicine. This happened, she suggests, as a means for doctors to reassert their authority over the intersex body in the face of increasing intersex activism in the 1990s and feminist critiques of intersex medical treatment. Davis argues the renaming of &#x2018;intersex&#x2019; as a &#x2018;disorder of sex development&#x2019; is strong evidence that the intersex diagnosis is dubious. Within the intersex community, though, disorder of sex development terminology is hotly disputed; some prefer not to use a term which pathologizes their bodies, while others prefer to think of intersex in scientific terms. Although terminology is currently a source of tension within the movement, Davis hopes intersex activists and their allies can come together to improve the lives of intersex people, their families, and future generations. However, for this to happen, the intersex diagnosis, as well as sex, gender, and sexuality, needs to be understood as socially constructed phenomena. A personal journey into medical and social activism, Contesting Intersex presents a unique perspective on how medical diagnoses can affect lives profoundly.</p><br><p>Ask us about setting up a Skype-in with the author for your class</p></p><p><b>Georgiann Davis</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

(<i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>"Contesting Intersex is an unapologetic coalescence of Davis first-hand experiences of an intersex diagnosis and her academic inquiry into the topic. Whilst this, as she acknowledges, &amp; may make the book read like an autoethnography at certain points, theory, politics and practice have never been discrete in intersex studies. Daviss own history and current participation in the intersex community help her to provide a circumspect consideration of the tensions at play." (<i>Sociology of Health &amp; Illness</i>)<br><br>"Davis presents a compelling and beautifully-crafted text about the complex issues of gender and sexual identity. How medicine and diagnosis can either come in aid of, or brutally disrupt the experience of intersexuality is an important paradox, worthy of reflection and debate. With this book, Davis gets the ball rolling and demands our attention. It is well-worth the read." (Annemarie Jutel,author of Putting a Name to It: Diagnosis in Contemporary Society)<br><br>"Through piercing interviews and astute analysis, and in a readable style, Contesting Intersex gets at the heart of recent controversies about the medical management of intersex and perceptively tracks the political engagement of intersex activists."

Based on a theoretical framework which has been tested in practice over 150 years, Bungay shows how the approach known as 'mission command' has been applied in businesses as diverse as pharmaceuticals and F1 racing today. <i><br><br>The Art of Action</i> is scholarly but engaging, rigorous but pragmatic, and shows how common sense can sometimes be surprising.</p><p>Stephen Bungay is a Director of the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre in London and teaches on several executive programmes at Ashridge Business School. Educated at Oxford and the University of Tubingen, he worked in the London and Munich offices of Boston Consulting Group for 17 years and also ran a division of an insurance company. He now works as an independent consultant, teacher and speaker. An acclaimed military historian, he has published various books, including a new edition of <i>The Most Dangerous Enemy: An Illustrated History of the Battle of Britain</i> and <i>Alamein.</i> He is a frequent contributor to television programmes, appearing on Channel 4, Channel 5, BBC2, BBC4, the History Channel, TV New Zealand and National Geographic.All too often, strategies fail to be implemented because they do not make tough choices between priorities and therefore leave people confused. The eminently pragmatic techniques described in this book are a great way of sharpening up the thinking, the communication and the sense of accountability needed to get an organisation moving. The ideas sound simple, but they are very powerful.&#x2015;<b>Martin Bean, Vice Chancellor, The Open University</b><br><br>Bungay takes a very surgical knife to some of today's sacred cows, contrasting organisational activity as opposed to action and deftly eviscerating the idea of slavish adherence to the Balanced Scorecard concept. If ever you needed a case against the idea that ticked boxes must inevitably lead to positive results, you have it right here. This is almost certainly the best work-related read I have enjoyed since Paul Kearns' The Value Motive. Indeed Stephen Bungay and Kearns share a clear and uncompromising language which emphasises the logic and clarity of their assertions. My lingering regret about this book is that for some who care to read it, it is already too late: they are in positions of command that they do not merit, and will tiptoe away in the hopes that they are not recognised. This book, nevertheless, should be required reading for anyone who aspires to own or manage any organisation, or part of one. If individuals are imbued with the right stuff this read will fall on very fertile ground indeed.&#x2015;<b>HR Zone</b><br><br>Leadership is an intangible value. What sets Stephen Bungay apart is that he draws upon his deep knowledge of historical military campaigns to highlight key leadership principles and then sets them in the context of modern business with an understanding of the particular challenges faced by each company he works for. The first part greatly entertains and captivates the audience and the second part really brings home the teachings we wish to impart. The results have been very good.&#x2015;<b>Tom Glocer, CEO, Thomson Reuters</b><br><br>The Art of Action is a must for anyone in business who takes their leadership responsibilities seriously. Stephen Bungay draws upon his deep understanding of business strategy and military history and describes principles in his book that will have a real impact for those who adopt them. The Art of Action is the strategic handbook for today built on the insights of yesterday. This will be compulsory reading for all of my unit heads.&#x2015;<b>Eliot Forster, CEO, Solace Pharmaceuticals</b><br><br>What do you get if you cross a military historian with a management consultant? You get this fascinating book by Stephen Bungay - Bungay is a comfortable with management as he is with history and here cleverly draws on his knowledge of the latter to influence his thinking - A must-read for any would-be strategist.&#x2015;<b>Director</b><br><br>We live in an age of strategic failure across the board - in international relations and economic affairs, on the battlefield as well as in the marketplace. Inventively and incisively, Stephen Bungay draws on Clausewitz's wisdom, military history, business literature, and common sense to develop the notion of 'directed opportunism' for breaking the ominous cycle of frustration.&#x2015;<b>Jonathan Stevenson, Professor of Strategic Studies, U.S. Naval War College</b><br><br>This is not just another book about strategy. The Art of Action does not only present a radical, counter-cultural solution to the impasse business is facing today but it is grounded in real strategic execution in a fascinating organisation. It is the 're-engineering the corporation' of the 21st century. I intend to send a copy to all my clients.&#x2015;<b>Aidan Walsh, Partner, Ernst &amp; Young</b><br><br>Stephen Bungay has something genuinely interesting to tell us. His book is not one of those vacuous essays in 'leadership qualities' of the 'how would Napoleon/MacArthur/Alexander the Great have turned around General Motors' variety ... What makes this book worth reading is the way in which Mr. Bungay calls time on an entire culture of gobbledygook. You don't succeed in warfare by having vague objectives and issuing ambiguous orders. And you shouldn't expect to succeed in business that way, either.&#x2015;<b>The Wall Street Journal</b><br><br>Stephen Bungay's career as CEO, management consultant and historian enable him to bring a unique clarity to leadership and the art of making strategy happen. His study of the chastened Prussian military machine analysing why it was defeated by Napoleon's peasant army is illuminated with anecdotes from his career in business. It is this blend of evidence from the military to the business environment which makes this book so useful to the modern day practitioner!&#x2015;<b>David Roblin, Senior Vice President, Pfizer Global R&amp;D</b></p><h2>The Secret Spiral of Swamp Kid</h2><p><b>"Kirk Scroggs is one of my favorite author/illustrators." --Dav Pilkey, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the <i>Captain Underpants and Dog Man</i> series.</b><br><br>WARNING! UNLESS YOU HAVE EXPRESS PERMISSION FROM RUSSELL WEINWRIGHT TO ACCESS HIS NOTEBOOK, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER. SERIOUSLY, WE MEAN IT.<br><br>Okay, if you are still with us, here is what we can share: Russell is a middle schooler; he excessively doodles; he has two best friends, Charlotte and Preston; he is not so great at sports; and he is pond scum. Nicknamed "Swamp Kid" by his classmates, Russell has algae for hair, a tree trunk for a right arm, and a carrot for a finger. Also, Russell's favorite meal is sunlight. Also, a frog lives in his arm. <br><br>In this notebook, Russell details in both hilarious text and color illustrations (complete with ketchup stains!) what it's like to be different, to discover his true talents, to avoid the intense stare of Mr. Finneca (his suspicious science teacher who may also be a mad scientist), and to find humor in the everyday weird. <br><br>This is <i>The Secret Spiral of Swamp Kid</i> by writer and illustrator Kirk Scroggs, and you'll never look at middle school the same way again.</p><p>Kirk is an author-illustrator best known for the <i>Snoop Troop</i> books, <i>It Came From Beneath the Playground</i>, and <i>Attack of the Ninja Potato Clones</i>, as well as the series <i>Tales of a Sixth-Grade Muppet </i>and <i>Wiley &amp; Grampa's Creature Features</i>.&#x201c;Kirk Scroggs is one of my favorite author/illustrators.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dav Pilkey, #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Captain Underpants series<br><br>&#x201c;A comedic win with appeal for fans of Tom Angleberger and DC's Teen Titans Go!&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i> review</p><h2>The Book of Certitude</h2><p><i>The Kitab-i-iqan</i>, <i>The Book of Certitude</i>, is one of the an important scriptural works in the Baha'i Faith. In it, Baha'u'llah gives a sweeping overview of religious truth, explaining the underlying unity of the world's religions, describing the universality of the revelations humankind has revceived from the Prophets of God, illuminating their fundamental teachings, and elucidating allegorical passages from the New Testament and the Qur'an that have given rise to misunderstanding among religious leaders, practitioners, and the public.</p><p><b>Baha'u'llah</b> (1817&#x2013;1892), meaning in Arabic 'the Glory of God,' is the Prophet and Founder of the Baha'i Faith. The main theme of Baha'u'llah's message is unity. He taught that there is only one God, that all the world's religions represent one changeless and eternal Faith of God, and that all humanity is one race destined to live in peace and harmony.The Baha'i Faith was founded by Baha'u'llah ("glory of God"), a 19th-century Iranian spiritual leader whom Bah&nbsp;'is regard as the most recent in a line of great prophets stretching back to Abraham. Bah&nbsp;'is celebrate nine annual festivals, including the 12-day spring observance of Ridvan (April 21-May 2), commemorating Baha'u'llah's mission on earth, and the Day of Ascension (May 29), marking the anniversary of his passing into immortality. This first-ever trade edition of Baha'u'llah's "Book of Certitude" offers the prolific author's account of the tenets of the faith and the universal mission of all religions. Bah&nbsp;'u'llah describes the role of prophets throughout history and calls some of his contemporaries to task for promulgating false or self-serving views about religion. The closing pages discuss prophecies of a new age, drawing upon both Christian and Muslim hopes for revelation. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>YOU: The Owner&#39;s Manual, Updated and Expanded Edition: An Insider&#39;s Guide to the Body that Will Make You Healthier and Younger</h2><p><p><strong>The #1 bestseller that gives YOU complete control over your body and your health.</strong></p><p>With new health studies and advice bombarding us every day, few people know much about what chugs, churns, and thumps throughout the miraculous system that is the human anatomy.</p><p><em>YOU: The Owner's Manual</em> challenges preconceived notions about how the human body works and ages, and takes you on a fascinating grand tour of all your blood-pumping, food-digesting, and numbers-remembering systems and organs&#x2014;including the heart, brain, lungs, immune system, bones, and sensory organs.</p><p>In this updated and expanded edition, America's favorite doctors, Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz, discuss how YOU actually have control over your genes.

A. C. Graham&#x2019;s slim but indispensable anthology of late T&#x2019;ang poetry begins with Tu Fu, commonly recognized as the greatest Chinese poet of all, whose final poems and sequences lament the pains of exile in images of crystalline strangeness. It continues with the work of six other masters, including the &#x201c;cold poet&#x201d; Meng Chiao, who wrote of retreat from civilization to the remoteness of the high mountains; the troubled and haunting Li Ho, who, as Graham writes, cultivated a &#x201c;wholly personal imagery of ghosts, blood, dying animals, weeping statues, whirlwinds, the will-o'-the-wisp&#x201d;; and the shimmeringly strange poems of illicit love and Taoist initiation of the enigmatic Li Shang-yin.

Visions of the Prehistoric Past</h2><p><p>It was 1830 when an English scientist named Henry De la Beche painted the first piece of paleoart, a dazzling, deliciously macabre vision of prehistoric reptiles battling underwater. Since then, artists the world over have conjured up visions of dinosaurs, woolly mammoths, cavemen, and other creatures, shaping our understanding of the primeval past through their exhilarating images.</p><p>In this unprecedented new book, writer Zo� Lescaze and artist Walton Ford present the astonishing history of paleoart from 1830 to 1990. These are not cave paintings produced thousands of years ago, but modern visions of prehistory: stunning paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, mosaics, and murals that mingle scientific fact with unbridled fantasy. The collection provides an in-depth look at this neglected niche of art history and shows how the artists charged with imagining extinct creatures often projected their own aesthetic whims onto prehistory, rendering the primordial past with dashes of Romanticism, Impressionism, Japonisme, Fauvism, and Art Nouveau, among other influences.</p><p>With an incisive essay from Lescaze, a preface by Ford, four fold-outs, and dozens of details, the book showcases a stunning collection of artworks culled from major natural history museums, obscure archives, and private collections, and includes new photography of key works, including Charles R. Knight&#x2019;s seminal paintings in Chicago and little-known masterpieces such as A. M. Belashov&#x2019;s monumental mosaic in Moscow. From the fearsome to the fantastical, Paleoart is a celebration of prehistoric animals in art, and a novel chance to understand our favorite extinct beasts through an art historical lens.</p></p><p>Zo� Lescaze, auteur ind�pendant, vit � New York, o� elle est n�e et a grandi.

Stop stressing... Embrace the universe... Try yoga... Be fulfilled... and that's an order! We're overwhelmed with these sorts of commands, and we often torture ourselves to "try harder," yet somehow we never feel we've done quite enough.

This book is about a special kind of persuasion: &#39;flipnosis&#39;. It has an incubation period of just seconds, and can instantly disarm even the most discerning mind. Flipnosis is black-belt mind control. It doesn&#39;t just turn the tables, it kicks them over. From the malign but fascinating powers of psychopaths, serial killers and con men to the political genius of Winston Churchill - via the grandmasters of martial arts, Buddhist monks, magicians, advertisers, salesmen, CEOs and frogs that mug each other - Kevin Dutton&#39;s brilliantly original and revelatory book explores what cutting-edge science can teach us about the techniques of persuasion.</p><p>How many times a day do you think someone tries to persuade you? Twenty? Thirty? Actually it&#x2019;s more like <i>400.</i> When you imagine a society based on coercion you start to see how important persuasion is; it literally keeps us alive. Now psychologist Kevin Dutton has identified a powerful strain of immediate, instinctual persuasion,&nbsp;an elixir of influence that can immediately help you disarm skeptics, win arguments, close the deal, get the guy. Mapping the cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience of this incisive new&nbsp;influence, he introduces us to the natural super-persuaders in our midst Buddhist monks, magicians, advertisers, con men, hostage negotiators, even psychopaths. He shows us which simple triggers can make someone trust you immediately; what hidden pathways in the brain lead us to believe something even when we know it&#x2019;s not true; how group dynamics can make us more tolerant or deepen our extremism; and what we can learn from newborns about winning arguments. Dutton&#x2019;s fascinating and provocative book will help anyone tap into the power of split-second persuasion. <p></p> <br> <strong>A Q &amp; A With Author Kevin Dutton</strong> <br><br> <p><b>Q:</b> How did the idea for <i>Split-Second Persuasion</i> come about? </p> <p><b>A:</b> I was in San Francisco at a conference, and the hotel I was staying in had seen better days. Outside, a whole load of homeless people had set up shop with their cardboard banners and placards ("Hungry &amp; Homeless," "Vietnam Vet," "Six Months To Live," etc.) and during the course of the week I had made quite a few donations!</p> <p>Towards the end of my stay, I resolved not to part with any more cash (by this stage they had more money than I did.) But then on my last day a new guy had joined the ranks. I took one look at the slogan he was holding up ("Why Lie? I Want Beer!") and, without even thinking about it, put my hand in my pocket (earlier this year, in Sydney, Australia, I saw an even better one: "Schizophrenic. Been On The Street Six Months. Both Of Us." It had the same effect!)</p> <p>Up until then, as an expert in social influence, I&#x2019;d regarded persuasion as a matter of due process and negotiation&#x2014;as influence over time. But suddenly it dawned on me that there was clearly one strain of persuasion that short-circuited effortful processing and worked pretty much instantly.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Would you say that persuasion is an instinct?</p> <p><b>A:</b> Yes. In the animal kingdom, courtship rituals, threat displays, and appeasement postures are all about persuasion: persuading another member of your species to mate with you, to back off, or to lay off&#x2014;pretty much the same imperatives we face in our daily lives! Asking whether persuasion is an instinct is the same as asking whether getting our own way is an instinct. Of course it is&#x2014;who doesn&#x2019;t want to get their own way? And, as any parent will tell you, we start at a pretty young age!</p> <p>Moreover, more subtle forms of influence have also been found in animals. In 2009, Alicia Melis, a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found evidence of negotiation in chimpanzees&#x2014; suggesting that the basic capacity for arbitration probably emerged before we split from our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos.</p> <p>And biologist Karen McComb at the University of Sussex has discovered something interesting about cats: they employ a special "solicitation purr"&#x2014;an urgent, high-pitched cry embedded within a contented, low-pitch purr&#x2014;which hotwires their owners to fill up their food bowls at dinnertime.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Why do you say that babies are the best persuaders in the world?</p> <p><b>A:</b> Think about it. On our very first day on the planet, the influence task that faced us was immense. We had to persuade those around us, without language, without consciousness, without anything like the oratorical prowess that we possess as adults, to take care of us&#x2014;to subjugate their own interests at the expense of ours. And we did it. Otherwise, we wouldn&#x2019;t be here talking about it!</p> <p>How? Well, certainly not through any provision of our own. If we&#x2019;d had anything to do with it, we&#x2019;d almost certainly have blown it! Instead, natural selection took care of things for us by equipping us with three features, fitted as standard, fiendishly calibrated to cut straight through our ozone layer of deliberation, to go pounding up the slippery steps of consciousness, and to hammer unrelentingly on the secret emotional chambers of our heart, which are: </p> <p>1. A virtually unignorable soundtrack that figures at the top of nearly everyone&#x2019;s list of aversive acoustic stimuli;</p> <p>2. appallingly cute good looks, that prove pretty much irresistible to anyone caught in the spotlight;</p> <p>3. and a hard-wired propensity to make eye-contact, to attend to the eye-regions of faces.</p> <p>And boy, do these features work. In one study, a bunch of wallets were left on the streets of Edinburgh, each containing one of four photographs. A happy family. A cute puppy. An elderly couple. And a smiling baby. Which ones, the researchers wondered, would find their way back to their "owners" most often? </p> <p>There was no doubting the answer. Of the 40 wallets of each type that were dropped, 28% of those containing the portrait of the elderly couple made it back successfully; 48%, the family snapshot; 53%, the photo of the cute puppy.</p> <p>And a whopping 88%, the picture of the smiling baby!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Can we all learn to become split-second persuaders? </p> <p><b>A:</b> Just as with many things in life, persuasion ability is subject to considerable variation. Some of us are going to be naturally better at it than others. And some of us&#x2014;a vanishingly small minority&#x2014;are destined to be persuasion A-listers. So just as it&#x2019;s true that not everyone can run an Olympic qualifying time for, say, 100 metres, not everyone, I&#x2019;m afraid, has the raw influence talent to become a split second persuader.</p> <p>But that isn&#x2019;t to say that we can&#x2019;t become better persuaders. "We are what we repeatedly do," wrote Aristotle. "Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." In other words, one of the ways we can become a better persuader is by going out there and persuading people!</p> <p>When I was writing <i>Split-Second Persuasion</i>, I spent some time with some of the world&#x2019;s top con artists. These guys are influence black-belts, no doubt about it. Yet natural talent apart, the most striking difference between these evil- influence geniuses and the rest of us is this: persuasion, to them, is a lifestyle. It isn&#x2019;t something that they suddenly turn on when they want something. Instead, it&#x2019;s their whole demeanor.</p> <p>Through a combination of knowledge and practice, we can all increase our influence potential. An example: one of the con artists who I interviewed told me an interesting stat: 99% of people make the same, fundamental error when it comes to persuasion&#x2014;99% of people think that the secret of persuasion is getting someone to do something for you. It isn&#x2019;t. The secret of persuasion is getting someone to do something for themselves&#x2014;the principle of Perceived Self-Interest. Now, once you know that, you start to think in a completely different way. How can I frame my message so that it appears to benefit the other person and not me...?</p> <p></p> <br> <br>How many times a day do you think someone tries to persuade you? Twenty? Thirty? Actually it&#x2019;s more like four hundred. Psychologist Kevin Dutton has identified a powerful strain of immediate, instinctual persuasion, an elixir of influence that can immediately help you disarm skeptics, win arguments, close the deal.

In modern times, we have divorced color from its origins, using it for commercial advantage. Spike Bucklow shows us how in medieval times, color had mystical significance far beyond the enjoyment of shade and hue.</p><p>Each chapter demonstrates the mindset of medieval Europe and is devoted to just one color, acknowledging its connections with life in the pre-modern world. Colors examined and explained in detail include a midnight blue called ultramarine, an opaque red called vermilion, a multitude of colors made from metals, a transparent red called dragonsblood, and, finally, gold.</p><p>Today, &#x201c;scarlet&#x201d; describes a color, but it was originally a type of cloth. Henry VI's wardrobe accounts from 1438 to 1489 show that his cheapest scarlet was �14.2s.6d. and that scarlets could fetch up to twice that price. In the fifteenth century, a mid-priced scarlet cost more than two thousand kilos of cheese or one thousand liters of wine. This expense accounts for the custom of giving important visitors the "red carpet treatment."</p><p>The book looks at how color was &#x201c;read&#x201d; in the Middle Ages and returns to materials to look at the hidden meaning of the artists' version of the philosopher's stone.

The wildebeest, warthog, vulture, hyena and marabou stork swagger proudly across the savannah, rejoicing in their ugliness - and delighting their babies, who think they&#39;re perfect just the way they are. Inspired by the real-life Ugly Five safari animals, Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler&#39;s brand-new picture book is a jubilant celebration of animals who are often rather unloved. The funny, heart-warming rhyme is a joy to read aloud, while bold, comical illustrations bring the savannah spectacularly to life.</p><p>Julia Donaldson served as the UK Children's Laureate from 2011 to 2013 and has written many bestselling and beloved picture books and novels for young readers.

The practice of Recapitulation can do just this through a series of energetic exercises that can ultimately free us from the repetitive emotional conflicts and persistent negative patterns that often result from trauma. <br><br>Victor Sanchez shares with the reader both the philosophy and practical applications of this ancient Toltec technique. Anyone who has lived through a long, difficult experience--perhaps a serious illness, broken relationship, sexual abuse, or a childhood spent in a divisive family environment--can benefit from this process. Recapitulation makes it possible to actually relive and resolve the events that have caused emotional distress. In this clear and straightforward workbook, the author guides readers through the ten steps of Recapitulation and invites them to experience the powerful and positive new energy that results from healing the wounds of the past. <i>The Toltec Path of Recapitulation</i> offers an ancient ritual of renewal for the contemporary world.</p><p>Recapitulation is an ancient Toltec ritual that helps people resolve traumatic events by reliving them. Unlike modern regressive therapy that focuses on healing psychological wounds, <i>The Toltec Path of Recapitulation</i> is geared toward healing the energetic body, explains author Victor Sanchez. "When we talk about our energetic body, we are talking about something that is different from the ego," Sanchez writes. Instead, it is the "energy surrounding the physical body, which is known as the aura; feelings, and the dream body." Using a 10-step technique, Sanchez shows readers how to enter a trance to relive the pain of the past, then start the process of energetic restoration. Readers may be alarmed to find that recapitulation takes place alone, inside a wooden box with a hinged door. Comfort comes in knowing that Sanchez, whose previous works include <i>The Teachings of Don Carlos</i>, is an ethical and skilled guide. He offers detailed instructions as well as strong caveats about who should and shouldn't embark on this intensive and rewarding work. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Victor Sanchez has dedicated his life to the preservation of the traditions of the indigenous peoples of Mexico with whom he has lived for 15 years. He is the author of <i>The Teachings of Don Carlos</i> and <i>Toltecs of the New Millenium</i> and conducts workshops worldwide.

He was brought up to speak Latin as his mother tongue and always retained a Latin turn of mind; though he knew Greek, he preferred to use translations. After studying law he eventually became counselor to the Parlement of Bordeaux. He married in 1565. In 1569 he published his French version of the <b>Natural Theology</b> of Raymond Sebond; his <b>Apology</b> is only partly a defense of Sebond and sets skeptical limits to human reasoning about God, man and nature. He retired in 1571 to his lands at Montaigne, devoting himself to reading and reflection and to composing his <b>Essays</b> (first version, 1580). He loathed the fanaticism and cruelties of the religious wars of the period, but sided with Catholic orthodoxy and legitimate monarchy. He was twice elected Mayor of Bordeaux (1581 and 1583), a post he held for four years. He died at Montaigne (1592) while preparing the final, and richest, edition of his <b>Essays</b>.</p><h2>IndiVisible: African-Native American Lives in the Americas</h2><p>Throughout American history, people of combined African and Native American descent have often struggled for acceptance, not only from dominant cultures but also from their own communities.

Just five months later, the so-called Zoot Suit Riot erupted, as white soldiers in the city attacked minority youths and burned their distinctive zoot suits. Eduardo Obregon Pagan here provides the first comprehensive social history of both the trial and the riot and argues that they resulted from a volatile mix of racial and social tensions that had long been simmering.<br><br>In reconstructing the lives of the murder victim and those accused of the crime, Pagan contends that neither the convictions (which were based on little hard evidence) nor the ensuing riot arose simply from anti-Mexican sentiment. He demonstrates instead that a variety of pre-existing stresses, including demographic pressures, anxiety about nascent youth culture, and the war effort all contributed to the social tension and the eruption of violence. Moreover, he recovers a multidimensional picture of Los Angeles during World War II that incorporates the complex intersections of music, fashion, violence, race relations, and neighborhood activism. <br><br>Drawing upon overlooked evidence, Pagan concludes by reconstructing the murder scene and proposes a compelling theory about what really happened the night of the murder.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Murder at Sleepy Lagoon</i> does more than sharpen the edges of a well-worn story. . . . It also serves as a superb case study of the myriad factors that have influenced the course of race relations in the United States. . . . Pagan has constructed an impressive study of modern American race relations that should resonate beyond the fields of Los Angeles and Mexican American history."-- <i>Pacific Historical Review</i> <br>Eduardo Obregon Pagan is associate professor and chair of the Department of American Studies at Arizona State University West.</p><h2>Cold As Ice</h2><p>&#x201c;From the first page to the last, Julie&#x2019;s mysteries grab the reader and don&#x2019;t let up.&#x201d; &#x2013; Sally Berneathy, USA Today Bestselling Author Ellison Russell&#x2019;s life resembles a rollercoaster ride.

And it's his mother's idea for him to chronicle his life as a tortured sixth-grader, not his. One day Greg will be famous, but "for now I'm stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons." In a voice that brings to mind Holden Caulfield and David Sedaris rolled into one, Greg discusses the fleeting nature of popularity, the logic of bullying, and the fickleness of the fairer sex. Narrator Ramon de Ocampo is completely tuned in to Greg's angst-filled point of view. Though Greg is not always what you'd call a sympathetic character, de Ocampo's well-dramatized, insightful presentations of his various plights evoke our empathy--and laughter.

Some are weakened by scruples about things which are strictly neither right nor wrong, while others assert their liberty in a way which risks doing violence to the consciences of the weak. It was this situation which the Apostle Paul addressed in Romans 14. He insisted that, while Christian liberty was to be maintained, it was never to be asserted in such a way as to hurt the consciences of others, or to embolden them to do what they believed to be wrong. In this the last volume of the series, Dr Lloyd-Jones explains the implications of this issue for the church today. The fitting conclusion of his exposition of Romans is that true Christianity is not, in the end, concerned with such matters as what may be eaten or what days should be observed, but with a divine kingdom, characterized by inward righteousness, peace and joy.</p><p></p><h2>Never Ask a Man the Size of His Spread: A Cowgirl&#39;s Guide to Life</h2><p><p>Henry Ward Beecher said &#x201c;the common sense of one century is the common sense of the next.&#x201d; That said, these pocket-sized humor books pack quite a bit of punch&#x2015;lines that is.

But despite the availability of technologies that can provide wireless, personalized health care at lower cost, the medical community has resisted change. In <i>The Creative Destruction of Medicine</i>, Eric Topol-one of the nation's top physicians-calls for consumer activism to demand innovation and the democratization of medical care. <i>The Creative Destruction of Medicine</i> is the definitive account of the coming disruption of medicine, written by the field's leading voice.<br></p><p><b>Eric Topol, M.D.</b> is the director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute and co-founder and vice-chairman of the West Wireless Health Institute in La Jolla, California. He is a practicing cardiologist at the Scripps Clinic and a professor of genomics at The Scripps Research Institute. One of the top 10 most cited researchers in medicine, Topol was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and has led many of the trials that have shaped contemporary treatment for heart disease."Dr. Eric Topol is an extraordinary doctor. He's started a leading medical school, identified the first genes to underlie development of heart disease, led major medical centers, and been a pioneer of wireless medicine. But he is also a remarkable communicator-one of the few top-flight scientists in medicine to be able to genuinely connect with the public. He was, for example, the first physician researcher to question the safety of Vioxx-and unlike most who raise safety questions, actually succeed in bringing the concerns to public attention. I have known and admired Dr. Topol for a long time. I recommend him highly."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Atul Gawande, M.D., author of <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i></b></i></b><br><br>"It may sound like hyperbole, but it's true: Medicine is undergoing its biggest revolution since the invention of the germ theory.

Soldierman, sailorman and pioneer</i><br><i>Get yourself a girl and a bottle too</i>,<br><i>Blind yourself, hide yourself, the storm is near.</i></p></blockquote><p><b>SATURDAY, DECEMBER 6&#x2013;MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1941</b><br><i>Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands</i></p><p>It was late morning on Saturday, December 6, when they began filing into the post theater at Nichols Field, an American procession of sunglasses, swagger, Vitalis, and lit cigarettes with the brass insignia of Army Air Forces pilots, winged propellers, pinned to their collars.</p><p>An assortment of accents, body types, and backgrounds, the fifty-odd pilots of the 17th and 21st Pursuit Squadrons assembled in uniform fashion: clean khaki, college rings, and lieutenant&#x2019;s bars, with overseas and crush caps perched rakishly on their heads. They carried photographs of their wives and sweethearts in their wallets, but each shared the same, seductive mistress: a love of flying. That love, as well as an appetite for adventure and a sense of duty, had brought them from all corners of the United States to this USAAF base in the Philippines. The 1939 Hollywood blockbuster<i>Gone With the Wind</i> was currently playing in the theater, but the lights did not dim on this warm, peaceful Philippine morning. These pilots were not here to see Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.</p><p>With crossed arms, Col. Harold H. &#x201c;Pursuit&#x201d; George waited for stragglers to take seats. George, the forty-nine-year-old chief of staff of the Far East Air Force&#x2019;s 5th Interceptor Command, was a short, bespectacled, and brilliant officer with a magnetic personality. A decorated pilot in the Great War, he had piercing black eyes. Through the lazy gray haze of curling cigarette smoke, George made a sweeping reconnaissance of the room. Chatter ceased. Zippo lighters snapped shut with a clink. Pursuit George, as was his way, got to the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Men, you are not a suicide squadron yet, but you&#x2019;re damned close to it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There will be war with Japan in a very few days. It may come in a matter of hours.&#x201d;</p><p>George paused. The monotonous drone of airplane motors on testing blocks filled the dewy tropical air. Leather soles nervously scraped the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;The Japs have a minimum of 3,000 planes they can send down on us from Formosa and from aircraft carriers. They know the way already. When they come again, they will be tossing something.&#x201d;</p><p>There was church silence. None of the pilots, most of whom were rookies in their early twenties, had seen aerial combat. But George&#x2019;s bombshell had not caught 1st Lt. Ed Dyess by surprise. Dyess, the twenty-five-year-old commanding officer of the 21st Pursuit, had watched the winds of war whip the wind sock at San Francisco&#x2019;s Hamilton Field and for months had worked and prayed that his raw outfit would be ready. The odds, however, had been stacked against him long before he had descended the gangplank from the <i>President Coolidge</i> to Pier 7 in Manila back on November 20, 1941.</p><p>According to Japan&#x2019;s militarists, the rising sun of Amaterasu, the ancient goddess of creation, was waking the Yamato race to its destiny. The annexations of Formosa, Korea, and Manchuria, followed by an invasion of China in 1937, signaled Japan&#x2019;s desire to resurrect the holy mission of Jimmu Tenno&#x2014;Japan&#x2019;s first emperor circa 660 b.c.&#x2014;called <i>hakko ichiu</i>, meaning to forcefully bring &#x201c;the eight corners of the world under one roof.&#x201d;</p><p>By the summer of 1941, the United States could no longer ignore the gathering Pacific storm. President Franklin D. Roosevelt commenced a diplomatic chess game with Japan, halting exports of American oil, iron, and rubber, freezing Japanese assets in the United States, and closing the Panama Canal to Nippon&#x2019;s merchant vessels. Roosevelt then looked to America&#x2019;s most distant ward and its most powerful overseas base, the Philippine Islands, which had been ceded to the United States by Spain after the Spanish-American War. He recalled to active duty sixty-one-year-old Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the former chief of staff, who since 1935 had lived in Manila while serving as military adviser to President Manuel Quezon&#x2019;s nascent commonwealth government. MacArthur was given command of all forces in the islands, designated USAFFE&#x2014;United States Army Forces, Far East&#x2014;but before he could build a Pacific bulwark, he first had to reinvigorate a slumbering command and repair decades of neglect.</p><p>The relentless climate&#x2014;MacArthur called it an &#x201c;unchanging cocoon of tropical heat&#x201d;&#x2014;had gradually suffused the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Philippine Department in a universal lethargy. There was a five-hour workday, from 0700 to noon. As the mercury rose, men retreated to their billets and barracks, tuned their radios to Stations KZRH, &#x201c;the Voice of the Orient,&#x201d; for news and KZRM for big band hits, and took siestas while the blades of electric fans moiled the languorous air. An exchange rate of two Philippine pesos per U.S. dollar ensured that Filipino houseboys kept their bunks neat and their shoes shined, that <i>lavanderas</i> kept their custom-made uniforms and sharkskin suits pressed, and that they could send a few dollars home. Though the islands were rumored to contain a collection of aging and incompetent officers and enlisted eight balls, most were energetic young officers and soldiers using the assignment as either a career springboard or a means to escape the Great Depression.</p><p>Poker, baseball, and air-conditioned double features were pastimes for enlisted men; officers golfed or rode their ponies across the Manila Polo Club. At night men from Clark Field and Fort Stotsenburg, the sprawling 150,000-acre U.S. Army complex seventy miles north of Manila in the foothills of the Zambales Mountains, slugged ice-cold bottles of San Miguel beer at the Star Bar while airmen at Nichols Field haunted joints like the Chicago Bar in nearby Para�aque. The real action, however, was found in Manila, a lively hive of culture and commerce abuzz with music from the nightclubs lining Rizal Avenue and the Escolta and aglow with the romantic incandescence of the neon signs advertising the Alhambra Cigar Company and La Insular Cigarettes. Soldiers caught furtive glances from raven-haired Filipinas, drank Tanduay rum, and danced at the Santa Ana Cabaret while sailors drank at the Silver Dollar and staggered out into the sultry night air redolent of jasmine, sewage, and burning incense. Officers mingled with Manila&#x2019;s social elite in the Jai Alai Building&#x2019;s Sky Room and debated the football fortunes of West Point and Annapolis at the Army-Navy Club. Any way one looked at it, from an officer&#x2019;s privileged view or from the vantage point of those in the enlisted ranks, the Philippines seemed a serviceman&#x2019;s Shangri-la.</p><p>But the combat prowess of U.S. troops was unknown. MacArthur also suffered a severe numerical disadvantage: he could oppose Japan&#x2019;s military might with only the 22,000 troops comprising the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Philippine Division: the all-American 31st Infantry and two regiments of Philippine Scouts, crack Filipino soldiers serving under U.S. officers. Ten Philippine Army reserve divisions would soon be available, but these troops, noted one observer, knew how to do little else but salute and line up for chow.</p><p>The American and Filipino soldiers thus far mustered drilled with brimmed model M1917A1 &#x201c;doughboy&#x201d; steel helmets and coconut fiber pith helmets and old Springfield 1903 and Enfield rifles. Glaringly, there were no tanks or armored vehicles in the Philippines. Two years after the bloody slaughter of Polish lancers by German tanks, anachronistic cavalry troops still galloped across the immaculate grounds of Fort Stotsenburg. Hangars throughout the archipelago housed mostly observation planes, obsolete bombers, and pursuit planes. The Asiatic Fleet was still anchored in the past at Cavite, near where Commodore George Dewey&#x2019;s squadron had sunk the Spanish fleet in 1898, a skeleton force of cruisers, old flush-deck destroyers, submarines, tankers, and PT boats, &#x201c;a little stick which the United States carried while talking loudly in the Far East,&#x201d; remarked an Associated Press correspondent.</p><p>Inside USAFFE headquarters at No. 1 Call� Victoria in Intramuros, the old Spanish fortress city at the mouth of the Pasig River, MacArthur went to work. He deemed War Plan Orange&#x2014;a contingency plan developed in the 1920s that called for American forces to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula and the fortified islands of Manila Bay and wait for the Navy to dispatch the Japanese fleet&#x2014;&#x201c;defeatist.&#x201d; Instead he argued for an aggressive defense of the Philippines. Such a plan, taking into account the sheer size of the Philippines&#x2014;the archipelago was composed of 7,107 islands and nearly 100,000 square miles of shoreline segmented into the three main island groups: Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao&#x2014;was impractical. Envisioning the Philippines&#x2014;and himself&#x2014;as the nexus of America&#x2019;s military presence in the Pacific, the egotistical commander requested an expansion of his mission in late 1941.</p><p>The War Department, viewing the Philippines as, in the words of Secretary of War Henry Stimson, a &#x201c;strategic opportunity of utmost importance,&#x201d; would accommodate MacArthur. Stimson and Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall had convinced FDR that with enough time, the islands could become an impregnable stronghold&#x2014;America&#x2019;s Singapore. The advent of Rainbow 5, the War Department&#x2019;s newest plan for a global, multi-theater conflict, illustrated Washington&#x2019;s commitment. The AAF agreed to ferry thirty-five new B-17 Flying Fortresses, one-third of its existing bomber strength, to the islands, and promised ninety-five more B-17s and B-24 Liberators and 195 brand-new Curtiss P-40B and P-40E Warhawk pursuit planes, as well as fifty-t...</p></p><h2>Overthrowing the Old Gods: Aleister Crowley and the Book of the Law</h2><p>New commentaries on Aleister Crowley&#x2019;s Book of the Law reveal how it is connected to both Right- and Left-Hand Paths <br> <br>� Examines each line of the Book of the Law in the light of modern psychology, Egyptology, Gurdjieff&#x2019;s teachings, and contemporary Left-Hand Path thought <br> <br>� Explores Crowley&#x2019;s identification with the First Beast of Revelation as well as his adoption of the Loki archetype for becoming a vessel of love for all humanity <br> <br>� Recasts the Cairo Working as a text of personal sovereignty and a relevant tool for personal transformation <br> <br>� Includes commentary on the Book of the Law by Dr. Michael A. Aquino, who served as High Priest of the Temple of Set from 1975 to 1996 <br> <br>Received by Aleister Crowley in April 1904 in Cairo, Egypt, the Book of the Law is the most provocative record of magical working in several hundred years, affecting not only organizations directly associated with Crowley such as the Ordo Templi Orientis but also modern Wicca, Chaos Magic, and the Temple of Set. <br> <br>Boldly defying Crowley&#x2019;s warning not to comment on the Book of the Law, Ipsissimus Don Webb provides in-depth interpretation from both Black and White Magical perspectives, including commentary from Dr. Michael A. Aquino, who served as High Priest of the Temple of Set from 1975 to 1996. Webb examines each line of the Book in the light of modern psychology, Egyptology, existentialism, and competing occult systems such as the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and contemporary Left-Hand Path thought. Discarding the common image of Crowley formulated in a spiritually unsophisticated time when the devotee of the Left-Hand Path was dismissed as a selfish evil doer, Webb unveils a new side of Crowley based on his adoption of the Loki archetype and his aim to become a vessel of love for all humanity. In so doing, he shows how the Book of the Law is connected to both Right- and Left-Hand Paths and reveals how Crowley&#x2019;s magical path of mastery over the self and Cosmos overthrew the gods of old religion, which had kept humanity asleep to dream the nightmare of history. <br> <br>Providing in-depth analysis of Crowley&#x2019;s sources and his self-identification with the First Beast of Revelation from a profound esoteric perspective, Webb takes his views out of the Golden Dawn matrix within which he received the Book of the Law and radically recasts the Cairo Working as a text of personal sovereignty and a relevant tool for personal transformation.</p><p>Ipsissimus Don Webb joined the Temple of Set in 1989 and served as its High Priest from 1996 to 2002. He has written and lectured on Left-Hand Path topics and the occult practices of Late Antiquity since 1995. He lives in Austin, Texas.<b>The Force <br> <br>Chapter 4 <br>DISCERNMENT AND THELEMA</b> <br> <br>One of the odd pieces of advice that Mr. Crowley gives us frequently in his writings is that we should learn not to think about the differences between things as part of our development. On the surface this seems absurd--I obviously want to know the difference between drain cleaner and sugar when I make cinnamon toast. However once his instructions are seen as a part of a magical/initiatory system there is some wisdom in his suggestion if we approach this idea with Moderation, which is the watchword of the Left-Hand Path, rather than Submission, which is the watchword of the Right Hand Path. I would want to look at the First Beast&#x2019;s idea and consider its usefulness in Setian Initiation. <br> <br>Crowley&#x2019;s idea comes from four human sources--the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Nietzsche, and the Marquis de Sade--and also from practical magical experience. <br> <br>From the Buddha, Crowley draws the idea of dissatisfaction as a threat to the Path. Consider the person who can never enjoy his life. He has won second place in a tough contest, but knows only agony that he did not get first place. He sees the table next to his at the restaurant has cherries jubilee, and suddenly he hates his cheesecake. He drops his friend of many years who is a chiropractor to impress his new friend who is a medical doctor. This dissatisfaction does not lead to better states of being but to an anxiety that keeps him from ever awakening. There is no moment that is real to this person because his connection to the outside universe is shattered by his imagination of its flaws. He can never appreciate what he has, which means he is unhappy. More importantly he tells his psyche all the time, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t do very good magic.&#x201d; Eventually the psyche will give up. Why should it change the possibilities when it will be castigated? <br> <br>From Lao Tzu, Crowley draws the idea of Process. Magicians send out a mysterious message and receive a mysterious reply form the universe. This means they have to be open to the process unfolding by the art that is theirs to command, rather than being a critic of the process (having as they say &#x201c;lust for results.&#x201d;) It makes me think of the Taoist fable of the horse. <br> <br>Some mysterious beast was destroying a farmer&#x2019;s crops by night. &#x201c;Oh no! This is terrible!&#x201d; his neighbors say. The farmer says, &#x201c;We shall see.&#x201d; The farmer&#x2019;s son catches the animal and finds it to be a beautiful white stallion that he trains. The neighbors say, &#x201c;You are blest by the gods with good fortune!&#x201d; The farmer says, &#x201c;We shall see.&#x201d; The horse throws the son and breaks his leg. &#x201c;Oh no! This is terrible!&#x201d; his neighbors say. The farmer says, &#x201c;We shall see.&#x201d; The Emperor&#x2019;s troops arrive taking all able-bodied men to fight the Mongols, but spare the farmer&#x2019;s son, because of his broken leg. &#x201c;You are blest by the gods with good fortune!&#x201d; his neighbors say. The farmer says, &#x201c;We shall see.&#x201d; <br> <br>The magician learns to accept the bigger picture, that his magic is Working and does not make judgments as the process unfolds. The flu that keeps you home may keep you from the car wreck. The unstable magician tries to change the process at every step and winds up living in a muddy magical soup. <br> <br>From Nietzsche, Crowley received the idea that the Will provides its own training. We need a certain number of failures to become strong and crafty enough for success. If at every set- back we gave up, we certainly would never have learned to ride a bike. If at every brick wall we hit we just called on our parents, God, or the fates to save us, we would not have developed Will. The Initiate does not waste his time bemoaning setbacks and seeking aid, he spends his energy thinking his way out of the situation and in so doing develops Will. <br> <br>From the Marquis de Sade, Crowley drew the idea that classifying everything as pleasant and unpleasant means you have a lot of unpleasant things in your life. How much more pleasant your life would be if you could learn to find as many sensations and situations pleasant. I won&#x2019;t dwell on the sexual implications of this. Consider something you do daily--like riding the subway. How different your entire life would be if rather than spending ten minutes a day hating some experience, you made it your quest to find it a pleasurable experience: reading the posters, studying the crowd, enjoying the hot air on cold days. <br> <br>Beyond these four sources Crowley drew on practical magical experience. People have only so much energy. Would you prefer spending your energy on analyzing a current experience or trying to beckon a wonderful experience out of the Unmanifest, which the profane call the &#x201c;future?&#x201d; Magicians usually come from groups that spend all their time critiquing the present, and then at some point discover that the energy they use on parody and sarcasm could just as well be spent on having a better future. They may appear to be less clever and cool then but are much closer to being captains of their own fate. <br> <br>So consider how Crowley&#x2019;s instruction to his Adepts not to distinguish any thing from another thing may be a useful one. It is also a very, very hard thing to learn. Learning to receive what the universe gives you requires a deep faith in yourself and your magic. It will make you calm, and it will make you daring (since you know that the universe will give you what you need and frequently what you want).</p><h2>Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe</h2><p>Both highly praised and intensely controversial, this brilliant book produces dramatic evidence that at one time the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches not only sanctioned unions between partners of the same sex, but sanctified them--in ceremonies strikingly similar to heterosexual marriage ceremonies.</p><p>"Boswell's book provides us with a whole new [historical] model for adult gay relationships."--Natalie Zemon Davis, Princeton University <br><br>"I have the greatest respect for John Boswell as an historian and as a person of integrity, and I feel his work will be of great help to the church in dealing with gay marriages."--Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore of New York<b>John Boswell</b>&nbsp;(1947&#x2013;1994) won&nbsp;the 1981 American Book Award for history for his groundbreaking work&nbsp;<i>Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century</i>.</p><h2>Padre Pio Under Investigation: The Secret Vatican Files</h2><p><p>On June 14, 1921, a priest knocks at the convent in San Giovanni Rotondo.

It is with relief that she accepts a peculiar commission from her Gentleman Rogue, Lord Harold Trowbridge&#x2014;to shadow his niece, Lady Desdemona, who has fled to Bath to avoid the attentions of the unsavoury Earl of Swithin.<br><br>But Jane's idle diversion turns deadly when a man is discovered stabbed to death in the Theatre Royal. Adding to the mystery is an unusual object found on the victim's body&#x2014;a pendant that contains a portrait of an eye! As Jane's fascination with scandal leads her deeper into the investigation, it becomes clear that she will not uncover the truth without some dangerous playacting of her own....</p><p>It's evident from the opening lines of <i>Jane and the Wandering Eye</i> that author Stephanie Barron knows both her Regency-period England <i>and</i> her Jane Austen. In this novel, the famous author takes center stage and finds herself embroiled in nefarious doings--in this case, the murder of a theater manager. As in the series' other books, Jane herself tells the story through a series of journal entries, and it is in her heroine's voice that Barron's genius comes to light: the same sharp eye for detail and ironic understanding of human character that informed Miss Austen's novels are hard at work in this fictional account of her sideline occupation as a sleuth. Though the mystery at the heart of <i>Jane and the Wandering Eye</i> is hardly a nail-biter, the wonderful mix of fictional and historical characters--all rendered up with Austenian wit--that inhabit this murderous comedy of manners are what will keep readers going to the very last page--<i>and</i> coming back for more.For everyone who loves Jane Austen...the third extraordinary mystery in the series that reimagines the well-loved author as a sleuth!<p>"A glimpse of what Jane Austen's world was like, as well as an intriguing mystery."<br><i>--The Rocky Mountain News</i></p><p>"Barron seamlessly weaves...a delightful and lively tale....Period details bring immediacy to a neatly choreographed dance through Bath society."<br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Barron's high level of invention testifies to an easy acquaintance with upper-class life and culture in Regency England and a fine grasp of Jane Austen's own literary style--not to mention a mischievous sense of fun."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>An Alternate Selection of the Mystery Guild</p><p></p></p><h2>Learning Good Consent: On Healthy Relationships and Survivor Support</h2><p>Cindy Crabb provides a DIY tour of the promise and perils of sexual relationships in <i>Learning Good Consent</i>.

When the business became a worldwide success, Postville found itself both revived and divided. The town's initial welcome of the Jews turned into confusion, dismay, and even disgust. By 1997, the town had engineered a vote on what everyone agreed was actually a referendum: whether or not these Jews should stay.<br><br>The quiet, restrained Iowans were astonished at these brash, assertive Hasidic Jews, who ignored the unwritten laws of Iowa behavior in almost every respect. The Lubavitchers, on the other hand, could not compromise with the world of Postville; their religion and their tradition quite literally forbade it. Were the Iowans prejudiced, or were the Lubavitchers simply unbearable?<br> <br>Award-winning journalist Stephen G. Bloom found himself with a bird's-eye view of this battle and gained a new perspective on questions that haunt America nationwide. What makes a community? How does one accept new and powerfully different traditions? Is money more important than history? In the dramatic and often poignant stories of the people of Postville - Jew and gentile, puzzled and puzzling, unyielding and unstoppable - lies a great swath of America today.<br> <br></p><p>Postville, Iowa (population 1,478), seems an unlikely place to find a sizable Jewish population, let alone an ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher population. It is, after all, in the heart of pork country, and the world headquarters of the Lubavitchers is far away in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. But when the Hygrade meat processing plant, just outside Postville, went belly-up, threatening the town with decline, Sholom Rubashkin bought it and turned it into a glatt kosher processing plant, complete with shochtim and a rabbinical inspectorate. By the late 1980s, "Postville had more rabbis per capita than any other city in the United States, perhaps the world."<p> The enterprise was a huge international success, with its kosher meats exported even to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Jewish population grew to 150, and they were rich. The town was saved, and the people were grateful. All's well that ends well? Not quite. The Hasidim kept to themselves, did things their own way, and basically had no interest in integrating into Postville. And why would they? Their laws are strict, their mission clear, their community defined by race and religion. They are not interested in watermelon socials or coffee klatches at the diner. Their little boys do not swim with their little girls, are not educated together, and do not go on play dates with goyim. Small-town Iowans, on the other hand, are very friendly. They know each other's news, they support each other's businesses, they wish each other Merry Christmas, they want you to feel at home. They don't like that the new townspeople stomp up the street hunched over, talking in a foreign language and looking straight through them when greeted. They really don't like it when one of the newcomers drives around town with a 10-foot candelabra strapped to his car playing music at full volume for eight consecutive winter nights. They don't actually know about menorahs or Hanukkah.</p><p> Into this comes secular Jew Stephen Bloom, a professor at the University of Iowa. By the time he arrived in Postville, the town was riven along religious lines. One of the townspeople was running for mayor on the sole platform of annexation of the land on which the plant stood. Rubashkin was threatening that he'd shut the plant and leave if that came to pass. Bloom closely considers both sides, and the result is a wonderful book. It is a fascinating tale of culture clash in the American heartland: the John Deere cap meets the black fur hat. It is a book about identity and community and what it means to be American. It covers all the things you aren't supposed to talk about at the dinner table--religion, politics, and even sex. It is full of suspense: Will the plant be annexed? Will the Jews leave? And it is also Bloom's exploration of his own sense of belonging. <i>--J.

At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing.

It is a story of contact and cultural exchange across countries and creeds, affecting many people from kings to the common crowd. This tradition formed the roots from which modern Western medicine arose. Contrary to the stereotypical picture, medieval Islamic medicine was not simply a conduit for Greek ideas, but a venue for innovation and change.<br><br><i>Medieval Islamic Medicine</i> is organized around five topics: the emergence of medieval Islamic medicine and its intense crosspollination with other cultures; the theoretical medical framework; the function of physicians within the larger society; medical care as seen through preserved case histories; and the role of magic and devout religious invocations in scholarly as well as everyday medicine. A concluding chapter on the "afterlife" concerns the impact of this tradition on modern European medical practices, and its continued practice today. The book includes an index of persons and their books; a timeline of developments in East and West; and a section on further reading.</p><p><b>Peter E.

This unique volume gives voice to a wide range of perspectives which stress different reactions to and uses of jazz, both within and across communities, enabling readers to see that jazz is not just about names, dates, and chords, but rather about issues and ideas, cultural activities, and experiences that have affected people deeply in a great variety of ways. Selections include contributions from well-known figures such as Jelly Roll Morton, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis; from renowned writers including Langston Hughes, Norman Mailer, and Ralph Ellison; and from critics and historians ranging from Gunther Schuller and Christopher Small to Sherrie Tucker and George Lipsitz. Filled with insightful writing, <em>Keeping Time</em> aims to increase historical awareness, to provoke critical thinking, and to encourage lively classroom discussion as students relive the intriguing story of jazz.<br></p><p><br>Edited by <strong>Robert Walser</strong>, Professor of Music, <em>Case Western Reserve University</em><br>These two compilations take very different approaches to understanding jazz. Keeping Time is a fairly traditional documentary history, using newspaper and magazine articles, interviews, and excerpts from autobiographies and secondary accounts. After explaining the early years of the music, Walser, chair of musicology at UCLA, provides fascinating material dealing with the jazz age in the 1920s, swing in the Thirties, and bebop in the Forties. The book is less convincing on the hard-bop 1950s, provides very little information on the avant-garde in the next decade, and largely ignores Seventies fusion. It ends with an excellent outline of the Wynton Marsalis-led return to traditionalism in the 1980s and a more general, less satisfying examination of jazz today. The Jazz Cadence of America attempts to show the reciprocal effects of jazz and American culture on each other. After dealing with definitions of "jazz," O'Meally (American literature, Columbia; Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday, LJ 11/1/91) traces the place of jazz in American society; the influence of the music on painting, architecture, photography, film, and dance; jazz history from different perspectives; and the impact of jazz on literature. Some sections provide fascinating insights into the relationship of jazz to the other arts, especially painting and literature. However, the book seldom shows the connection between jazz and American society or the effect of other aspects of American culture on jazz. Despite obvious flaws, The Jazz Cadence offers an innovative approach to understanding jazz within a larger social context. Complementing each other with little overlap, these two compilations are recommended as classroom texts.?David P.

It was greatly admired by his contemporaries, including George Eliot and G. H. Lewes. The novel centers on a case of forgery and the anguish, guilt, and pathos of the central character, Lady Mason. Youthful marriage choices, middle-aged martial crisis, and the moving love and loss of an elderly man revolve around the legal action and the complex portrayal of Lady Mason, who is both sympathetic and wily. The novel proposes a standard of morality higher than that embodied in the practice of an English court of law.<br><br>With its concern for social issues and its extensive coverage of middle-class and landed life, <em>Orley Farm</em> is a novel that demands attention in the rich field of nineteenth-century fiction.<br></p><p><br><strong>Francis O'Gorman</strong> has edited Anthony Trollope's <em>The Duke's Children, Framley Parsonage</em>, and <em>The Way We Live Now</em> for the Oxford World's Classics series, as well as John Ruskin's <em>Praeterita</em> and Elizabeth Gaskell's <em>Sylvia's Lovers</em>.

A strong empirical dimension tests theory and successfully applies it. With carefully crafted features and vivid examples, Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson&#x2019;s text helps answer two critical questions students ask, "Do people and firms really act as theory suggests" and "How can someone use microeconomics in a practical way?" <br><br>The authors teach in economics departments and business schools and are active empirical microeconomics researchers. Their grounding in different areas of empirical research allows them to present the evidence developed in the last 20 years that has tested and refined the fundamental theories. Their teaching and professional experiences are reflected in an outstanding presentation of theories and applications. </p></p><p></p><h2>Six Records of a Life Adrift (Hackett Classics)</h2><p>"Shen Fu's <i>Six Records of a Life Adrift</i> is the most intimate document at our disposal of private life in late imperial China. Graham Sanders now provides us with a new translation for the 21st century, which is not only well researched but also highly readable". --Wilt Idema, Harvard University</p><p><p>Graham Sanders is Associate Professor of classical Chinese literature at the University of Toronto.</p>This delightful nineteenth-century narrative, which has charmed Chinese audiences for over a century, has finally found its match in this new translation by Graham Sanders. His rendering in English comes from a deep understanding of the language, style and artistic structure of the original, and is enriched by informative notes explaining the differences between Chinese and Western culture. What this unforgettable confessional prose has to show us about human nature is clearly expressed. --Milena Dole&#x17e;elov�-Velingerov�, University of Toronto<br><br>Shen Fu's subtle yet emotional account of his love-match with Chen Yun, their relations with his family, his pastimes with friends and courtesans, his travels far and near, his frustrations with work and his obsessions at play illustrate the life of a Qing lower gentryman in a patriarchal family, but at the same time reveal human complexities that require the nuancing of simplistic over-generalizations about class, gender, tradition, Confucian family values, and the like. This lively new translation--the first in nearly thirty years--clarifies certain passages, helpfully adds section breaks, and provides explanatory footnotes. Also included are a family tree, a chronology, and other useful reference materials. The result is an edition that will enhance discussions in a variety of courses, from Chinese and world history to gender and family history. --Sarah Schneewind, University of California at San Diego<br><br>"Sanders's translation is the first to appear in almost thirty years, and it is the richest and most comprehensive of the three other English-language versions that are available. . . . Nearly every page in Sanders's translation has explanatory footnotes (including half of the first page), but more important, nearly every page also brings metaphors and imagery that will delight readers versed in the Western literary tradition. The book could be used in any number of courses, in addition to being a required reading for courses on imperial China. <i>Six Records of a Life Adrift</i> would be appropriate for gender studies courses, world literature, comparative literature, and creative writing. The brilliance of Shen Fu as a writer and Graham Sanders as a translator is nowhere more evident than in the scene describing Chen Yun's final moments. After alluding to her untimely demise several times, Shen Fu presents her passing in a beautiful passage of lachrymose prose. His grief is real.

A Rebirth [Tavallodi Digar] is a collection of a woman&#x2019;s new identity as &#x201c;woman as lover&#x201d; rather that &#x201c;woman as domestic&#x201d; in Iran. Of course, as lover, she was also an explorer. Thus Foroogh falls into the tradition of poet as explorer well exemplified by the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Gerard de Nerval. Her significance is in her exploratory capacity for love and life as an independent woman. A Rebirth represents a breakthrough in woman&#x2019;s writing in Iran; female eroticism and passion are explored in a context of the traditional female seclusion in household activities, finally breaking free from those bounds and bonds. In the appended poem, "Lets Bring Faith to the Onset of the Cold Season," in her lament for a dead lover she is said to have predicted her own death from a traffic accident&#x2014;at the untimely age of thirty-two.

It is a book rooted in our contemporary world, delving into ecological issues that are perennial, timeless, but could not be more timely.</p></p><p><b>Charles J. Krebs</b> is professor emeritus of zoology at the University of British Columbia and thinker in residence in the Institute for Applied Ecology at the University of Canberra. He is the author of <i>Population Fluctuations in Rodents</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;<i>Why Ecology Matters&nbsp;</i>is quite different from traditional ecology texts. Krebs does not attempt to cover classic studies or the authors of many of our main theories. To many ecologists, this will be a blasphemous approach to teaching ecology, but engaging a nonspecialist audience necessitates focusing on the major ideas and how they affect people, rather than on science per se. Rather than trying to cover all the core principles and concepts in ecology, Krebs covers twelve main messages, explicitly tying these messages to human-caused changes and impacts, as well as potential society feedback. In this way, he explores the full gamut of ecology for a range of readers.&#x201d; (Marc W. Cadotte, University of Toronto Scarborough, coeditor of "Invasive Species in a Globalized World: Ecological, Social, and Legal Perspectives on Policy")<br><br>"To this end, I...try to find topics and case studies that resonate with as many of my students as possible.

The metamorphosis is partially visible in the ascendance of glittering, coastal hubs for finance, infotech, and the so-called creative class. But this is only the tip of an economic iceberg, the bulk of which lies in the darkness of the declining heartland or on the dimly lit fringe of sprawling cities. This is America&#x2019;s hinterland, populated by towering grain threshers and hunched farmworkers, where laborers drawn from every corner of the world crowd into factories and &#x201c;fulfillment centers&#x201d; and where cold storage trailers are filled with fentanyl-bloated corpses when the morgues cannot contain the dead.<br><br> Urgent and unsparing, this book opens our eyes to America&#x2019;s new heart of darkness. Driven by an ever-expanding socioeconomic crisis, America&#x2019;s class structure is recomposing itself in new geographies of race, poverty, and production. The center has fallen. Riots ricochet from city to city led by no one in particular. Anarchists smash financial centers as a resurgent far right builds power in the countryside. Drawing on his direct experience of recent popular unrest, from the Occupy movement to the wave of riots and blockades that began in Ferguson, Missouri, Phil A. Neel provides a close-up view of this landscape in all its grim but captivating detail. Inaugurating the new Field Notes series, published in association with the <i>Brooklyn Rail</i>, Neel&#x2019;s book tells the intimate story of a life lived within America&#x2019;s hinterland.</p><p><b>Phil A. Neel</b> was raised in a mobile home in the Siskiyou Mountains, on the border of California and Oregon. He writes regularly on diverse topics and currently lives in Seattle."Tired of hearing from the so-called creative class? Frustrated with the complete failure of liberal elites to even comprehend what the problem is? Me too. This country, this world, is now utterly shaped by crisis and full of people living on margins&#x2014;social, economic, and geographic&#x2014;people who need not romantic elegies, hillbilly or otherwise, but studied attention by those able to understand history and its flows, who can report on the fine-grained life texture and large-scale patterns of populations both excluded from the economy and yet brutally integral to it. Globally, those who suffer most amount to a magnificent and terrible multitude. What is the logic of this crowd? Can they revolt against a social order that makes their lives expendable and cheap? Neel, in <i>Hinterland</i>, reports from far-flung places where people are forced to make do: a train full of migrant workers in southern China; Ferguson, Missouri; Jail Cell, USA. Neel writes in a visceral and stunning style of the slow apocalypse he everywhere finds, and he applies to these encounters a most unusual rigor. <i>Hinterland</i> is the geography lesson I&#x2019;ve been looking for all year." (Rachel Kushner, author of "The Mars Room" <i>Bookforum, "Best Books of the Year"</i>)<br><br>"Neel draws attention to the geography of class in Hinterland, identifying both a new working class and the global forces that have shaped it. . . . It would be easy for Neel to claim to be an authority on class in rural America on the strength of his own upbringing, as authors such as J. D. Vance have done. . . . Neel deliberately avoids this strategy. . . . Instead of describing a sense of class that is anchored in a specific region, Neel emphasizes that upheavals and dislocation connect working-class experience across regions and continents. . . . Neel doesn&#x2019;t propose to solve any current &#x2018;What&#x2019;s up in Trump country?&#x2019;debates. Instead he sets out to show the transformation, and often enough the hollowing out, of large tracts of twentieth-century life as the product of global capitalism. Hinterland is hectic and unsystematic but often tonic, not least because few people who think this way have seen most of the places Neel has, let alone from the standpoints he has sometimes occupied&#x2014;rioter, prisoner, day laborer. . . . [Neel&#x2019;s book] honors the view from below or from the hinterland, where class is something that happens to you, like the weather but worse and more unrelenting. This emphasis has much to recommend it: ethically in its attention to lived experience, politically in its emphasis on concrete conflicts, intellectually in its alertness to variation and nuance. . . . A meditation on the opacity of class experience, to those who live in it but also to those who theorize it." (Jedediah Purdy <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"Simply bracing. It is easy enough in my cozy state-supported Canadian research enclave to ignore how my working life is connected to a bankrupt town in the US hinterland or to the Chinese proletarian traveling to wherever the jobs have gone. But Neel makes the unifying, underlying dynamics hard to deny&#x2014;dynamics of dwindling state resources, growing demands stemming from unfolding climate catastrophe and rising superfluity, and deepening threats to government capacity and legitimacy. This is stark terrain that too few scholars glimpse with any clarity. Its implications are massive." (Sarah Brouillette <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"[A] savage, preternatural political economy treatise." (Thomas Meaney <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Thought-provoking. . . .

The book seeks to offer to Jews and Christians the real story of Jesus, a wholly observant, Pharisaic Rabbi who fought Roman paganism and oppression and was killed for it. While many Christians will be confused by its assertion that Jesus never claimed divinity and not only did not abrogate the Torah but observed every letter of the Law, they will find comfort in my tracing most of Jesus principal teachings back to Jewish sources, this before he was stripped of his Jewishness by later writers who sought to portray him as an enemy of his people. This is especially true of Jesus&#39; most famous oration, the Sermon on the Mount, which is a reformulation of the Torah he studied and to which he was committed. A small sampling: Jesus: (Matt 5:5) Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Hebrew Bible: (Psalms 37) The meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Jesus: (Matt 5:8) Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see G-d. Hebrew Bible: (Psalms 24) Who shall ascend the mount of the Lord the pure-hearted. Jesus: (Matt 5:39) But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. Hebrew Bible: (Lamentations 3:30) Let him offer his cheek to him who smites him.... Jesus: (Matt 6:33) But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well. Hebrew Bible: (Psalms 37:4) Delight yourself in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Jesus: (Matt 7:7) Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. Hebrew Bible: (Jer 29:13) When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart. Jesus: (Matt 7:23) Then I will declare to them, I never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers. Hebrew Bible: (Psalms 6:9) Depart from me, all you workers of evil... The book is also for Jews who remain deeply uncomfortable with Jesus because of the Church s long history of anti-Semitism, the deification of Jesus, and the Jewish rejection of any Messiah who has not fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. We Jews will forever reject the divinity of any man, the single most emphatic prohibition of our Bible. And we can never accept the Messiahship of any personality, however noble or well-intended, who died without ushering in the age of physical redemption. But as Christians and Jews now come together to love and support the majestic and humane Jewish state, it s time that Christians rediscover the deep Jewishness and religious Jewish commitment of Jesus, while Jews reexamine a lost son who was murdered by a brutal Roman state who sought to impose Roman culture and rule upon a tiny yet stubborn nation who will never be severed from their eternal covenant with the G-d of Israel.</p><p>"Shmuley in his own unique, iconoclastic, and controversial way, hits a home run with his new courageous book, Kosher Jesus. While showing understanding for the negative stereotypes many Jews &#x2013; especially European born &#x2013; have of Jesus, Christians and Christianity, he cuts through those perceptions and urges Jews and Christians to take a fresh look at the person of Jesus and to reclaim him for themselves in a truer, more genuine form. The mostly negative views Jews and Christians have had of one another over the centuries were certainly shaped by the fratricide that marked our relationship. It is high time they be revisited. Undoubtedly, not a few Rabbis will be outraged by this book. But certainly this Rabbi &#x2013; a colleague, friend, admirer, and &#x201c;fan of Shmuley&#x201d; &#x2013; will defend his thesis and many, if not most, of his points and view the opposition as Shmuley's red badge of courage. Given the advances that have been made in Christian-Jewish dialogue since the 1960s it is essential that both communities take another look at this central subject. And this book does just that.<br><br>"Kosher Jesus is essential reading for anyone seeking a truer understanding of who Jesus the Jew from Nazareth really was and the enormous contribution he made to the world. This courageous and thought provoking book is a breath of fresh air and major contribution to Jewish and Christian perceptions of Jesus. I hope it's read widely and changes attitudes in both communities." -- Founder and President, International Fellowship of Christians and Jews<br>"It is tragic that two great religions that worship the same God, cherish the same Scriptures and affirm the same moral code have been so antagonistic to each other for so long. May this book help to heal that breach." --Rabbi Harold Kushner, Author of When Bad Things Happen To Good PeopleShmuley Boteach is one of the worlds leading relationship experts and values and spirituality exponents.

Saturated with dramatic intensity and marked with Bernanos&#x2019;s inimitable fitful style, the novel follows young Fr. Donissan, a man of fervent faith but limited intelligence, striving to serve the Lord in his rural ministry. The priest&#x2019;s ability to plumb the depths of his flock&#x2019;s inner lives, along with his awareness of Satan on the prowl, grant him formidable opportunities of grace&#x2014;with a girl fallen prey to prostitution, with a child on the cusp of death, and with his fellow priests struggling with doubt.

But as I looked out over Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet, I could hear her voice in my head, clear as day.</p><p><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re cookin&#x2019; with fat.&#x201d;</i></p><p>The vintage clothes business was booming. Half a dozen customers were trying on peasant blouses and bell-bottom jeans embroidered with daisies and peace signs. A fortysomething woman rooted through a pile of vintage army jackets, hoping to find one that would accommodate her boyfriend&#x2019;s broad shoulders while he, on the other side of the store, examined frilly, lace-covered negligees for her. A pair of teenagers with Indian-print dresses draped over their arms paused on the way to the dressing room to flick through a rack of pastel 1950s cocktail dresses. Two young men tried on fedoras, checking themselves out in the three-way mirror, calling each other &#x201c;Frankie baby&#x201d; and casting surreptitious glances at the young women.</p><p>My good friends were staffing the herb stand and the front register; Bronwyn&#x2019;s hearty laugh and Maya&#x2019;s steady smile contributed to Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet&#x2019;s atmosphere of warmth and welcome. My unorthodox witch&#x2019;s familiar, Oscar, a miniature Vietnamese potbellied pig, snored softly on his purple silk pillow, tuckered out from the fussing and adoration he received from my customers&#x2014;and from trying to sneak a peek while they were in the fitting room.</p><p>And this evening, a handsome, frustrating, wildly fascinating man named Sailor would be coming for dinner. The ingredients for tonight&#x2019;s feast awaited me upstairs in my apartment&#x2019;s sunny kitchen; the menu featured jambalaya with all the fixings, just like Mama used to make on the all-too-rare occasions when she was pleased with me.</p><p>And while there might be a few lingering supernatural issues hanging over my head, at least I wasn&#x2019;t embroiled in a murder investigation.</p><p>I smiled to myself and let out a sigh of satisfaction. Yup. <i>Cookin&#x2019; with fat</i>.</p><p><i>Or not.</i></p><p>The back of my neck tingled in premonition. A moment later the bell over the front door rang out, its familiar tinkling sounding sharper, more demanding than usual.</p><p>I looked up from the tangle of belts I was sorting to see Inspector Carlos Romero, of the San Francisco Police Department&#x2019;s Homicide Division, stride into Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet. He wore his customary black thigh-length leather jacket, white oxford shirt, khakis, and black running shoes. And although he was only about my height, Carlos projected such an air of authority that he gave the impression of being a much larger man. Working the homicide beat in a major city wasn&#x2019;t a job for sissies.</p><p>My hand slipped down to stroke the medicine bag on the braided silk rope around my waist. The moment my fingers felt the familiar butter-soft leather studded with the beads I had sewn on as a child, I felt calmer, more grounded.</p><p><i>Maybe he&#x2019;s not here on business,</i> I thought. After all, Carlos and I were sort of friends, and every once in a while he dropped by the shop just to say hello. Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps he was in search of a costume for the upcoming Summer of Love Festival.</p><p>But his grim expression and the tingle at the back of my neck suggested this was not one of those times.</p><p><i>Dangitall</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Lily,&#x201d; Carlos said with a nod. &#x201c;A moment in private?&#x201d; His tone was curt, businesslike.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>I gestured to Bronwyn and Maya that I was taking a break and led Carlos through the deep red brocade curtain that separated Aunt Cora&#x2019;s Closet&#x2019;s display floor from the work area that doubled as a break room. A jumbo washer and dryer for laundering washable inventory sat to one side, while a galley kitchen with a dorm-sized fridge, a microwave, and an electric teakettle lined the opposite wall. A pile of black Hefty bags and a couple of blue plastic storage boxes held clothing to be sorted, repaired, and washed. In the center of the room was a sixties dinette set, the table topped with jade green Formica. The set was a replica of the one in my childhood home, in the little town of Jarod, West Texas.</p><p>Carlos took his usual seat.</p><p>&#x201c;May I get you anything?&#x201d; I asked, mostly out of habit because Carlos never accepted my offers of refreshments. &#x201c;How about a cup of tea? Bronwyn has a new blend of carob, orange peel, and rose hips which, I guarantee you, tastes a darn sight better than it sounds. It&#x2019;s all the rage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; he said with a quick shake of his head.</p><p>I sat in the chair opposite him and waited. He said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>One</i> day,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Beg pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would like one day. Just <i>one</i>. When I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about suspicious death.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos gazed at me for another long moment. He wasn&#x2019;t much of a talker under the best of circumstances, and in his line of work the long pauses surely served a purpose. More than a few cagey suspects and reluctant witnesses no doubt had blurted out something incriminating simply to break the oppressive silence. But this time was different; Carlos appeared to be choosing his words with care. And that probably meant he was here because he had come across something he couldn&#x2019;t explain, something that fell far outside the purview of a routine police investigation.</p><p>That was where I came in&#x2014;Lily Ivory, unofficial witchy consultant to the SFPD.</p><p>&#x201c;Today&#x2019;s not that day,&#x201d; he finally replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that was sort of my point. I was feeling so happy right before you came in.&#x201d;</p><p>One corner of his mouth kicked up in a reluctant smile. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me, all right. The bringer of bad tidings. So I ruined your day, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet you haven&#x2019;t. But something tells me you&#x2019;re about to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need to talk to you about a <i>curandera</i> shop gone haywire, a suspicious suicide, and a missing kid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;Aaaand there it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start at the beginning, shall I?&#x201d;</p><p>I sat back in my chair. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last week a thirty-seven-year-old woman named Nicky Utley jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear a lot of people jump off the bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, where does a witch come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Utley was into a bunch of strange stuff&#x2014;talismans and pentacles, books on everything from Catholic saints to candle magic, medicinal herbs and such. Things more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. overtly religious than your stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But how is any of that related to her death?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to figure out. According to her husband, the woman had been consulting with a woman named Ursula Moreno, who owns a shop called <i>El Pajarito</i> on Mission. What can you tell me about her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. I&#x2019;ve never heard of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I assumed all of your ilk knew each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My <i>ilk</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do. But I&#x2019;m still fairly new in town, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>And though I wasn&#x2019;t going to volunteer this to a member of the SFPD, friend or no, I kept my distance from <i>curanderas, </i>a Spanish term for &#x201c;healers.&#x201d; They were about as mixed a bag as the one I wore at my waist. Many were talented botanical specialists; others wise elders; a rare few were natural-born witches like me. Still others&#x2014;the vast majority&#x2014;dabbled in herbs and prayers and rituals, and enjoyed importing and creating talismans and amulets and good luck charms.</p><p>But a few were out-and-out charlatans.</p><p>In the course of my life I have learned many things, not the least of which is that&#x2014;witchy intuition aside&#x2014;I am a wretched judge of character. So I tried to steer clear of such shops and their proprietors. Besides, it was cheaper by far to purchase my supplies at small apothecaries in Chinatown, local farmers&#x2019; markets, or even the ethnic food aisle of a large grocery store. For the more esoteric witchy items, Maya had introduced me to the wonders of the Internet. A few clicks of the mouse, and a package of freeze-dried bats would appear on my doorstep in just a few days. As if by magic.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Carlos continued. &#x201c;It looks like the herbs and instructions and whatnot the victim got from the <i>curandera</i> may have aggravated an underlying condition that led to her suicide.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that. As I&#x2019;m sure you know, <i>curandera</i> means &#x2018;curer&#x2019; or &#x2018;healer.&#x2019; The herbs and &#x2018;whatnot,&#x2019; as you call them, are meant to help. But you have to know what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d; One of my biggest fears was that those who neither understood magical systems, nor gave them the proper respect, would end up hurting themselves or others. Amateurs experimenting with magic were like toddlers playing with matches&#x2014;sooner or later someone was bound to get hurt.</p><p>Carlos nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to find out. We have a couple of witnesses to the jump, but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you think there&#x2019;s more to it.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;Possibly. And the mayor&#x2019;s been on a tear lately, going after folks bilking the public with phony love spells, palm readings, fraudulent psychics, that sort of thing. This fits right in with his cleanup campaign.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought fortune-telling was covered by free speech. After all, who&#x2019;s to say they <i>aren&#x2019;t</i> seeing the future, or working magic?&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos&#x2019;s lips pressed together. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fine line between spewing predictions and conning people. Most of the time we&#x2019;re looking at charges of grand larceny and fraud, but in the case of Nicky Utley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, her husband&#x2019;s pushing hard to make something stick. The DA is considering filing charges of gross negligence and practicing medicine without a license, in addition to fraud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was the <i>curandera&#x2019;s</i> name, again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ursula Moreno. Her shop&#x2019;s called <i>El Pajarito</i>. You sure you don&#x2019;t know it?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head again. From the other side of the brocade curtain sounds drifted in: the cheerful buzz of customers trying out different personas as they tried on a new style of dress or hat; the chiming of my old-fashioned brass cash register; a young woman cooing over Oscar, who was probably preening, batting his sleepy eyes at her as he stretched lazily on his bed; the bell on the front door tinkling as another shopper arrived; and someone laughing in high, melodic tones.</p><p>The sounds were comforting, and I felt a fierce desire to tune out what Carlos was telling me. But I did not have that luxury. There aren&#x2019;t a lot of folks who know enough, or have the requisite skills, to assist the police with supernatural crimes. Carlos was here because he needed my special brand of help. Such, it seemed, was my fate.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; said Carlos.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, goodie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s happened, something odd.&#x201d; His finger traced an invisible pattern on the green Formica table top.</p><p>&#x201c;Odder than occult-inspired suicide?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Moreno&#x2019;s store. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. acting up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After Moreno was arrested yesterday, the forensics team went to her shop to gather evidence.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited, but he said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; I prompted.</p><p>&#x201c;The place went haywire. According to the chief forensics tech, stuff was flying off the shelves, the lights kept flickering on and off, a statue flicked a lit cigarette at one of the guys, and a bird skeleton seemed to come alive and appeared to start flying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s unusual behavior for a skeleton. Are you sure someone&#x2019;s not pulling your leg?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know these guys well, Lily. They&#x2019;re pros who deal with serious crime scenes every day. Chief forensic tech&#x2019;s been on the job for years&#x2014;it takes a lot to throw him off his game. But this time, he and his crew beat it out of the shop in a hurry, and they&#x2019;re refusing to go back. This is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unusual.&#x201d;</p><p>Indeed. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d like me to take a look.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos nodded. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t take too long. See what you see, feel what you feel. Try to figure out what&#x2019;s going on there, and if it&#x2019;s connected in any way to what happened to Nicky Utley.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All righty.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos gave me a suspicious look and cocked his head in question.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it? You&#x2019;re not going to try to get out of it?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve worn me down, Inspector. Guess I&#x2019;m the SFPD&#x2019;s go-to witch, right?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, and I couldn&#x2019;t help but smile in return. The thing about Carlos was that every smile felt hard-won, and therefore more worth the earning.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;This sounds like a job for an expert. If something untoward really is happening at the shop, somebody&#x2019;s bound to get hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos nodded and started to rise.</p><p>&#x201c;One question, though,&#x201d; I said, and Carlos sat back down. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of homicide&#x2019;s star investigators, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;So why is the department asking its big gun to work on a case of possible fortune-teller fraud?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I requested it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;May I ask why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First, because of the strange behavior at the store. I believe I&#x2019;ve told you I&#x2019;ve become the station&#x2019;s <i>woo-woo</i> guy. But, in the interest of full disclosure, it&#x2019;s also true that I knew the deceased, Nicky Utley, and her husband, Gary, though not well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Friends of yours?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Acquaintances more than friends. They went to my church, St. Olaf&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This would be a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Catholic church?&#x201d; I had met many Catholics in my life&#x2014;including Carlos&#x2014; and knew they were good people who lived according to a creed of kindness and respect. Still, organized religions made me nervous, what with the witch hunts and the pogroms and the Inquisition and all.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;If Nicky Utley was a practicing Catholic,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;why would she turn to a <i>curandera</i> for help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, of course the two don&#x2019;t preclude each other,&#x201d; I said, thinking aloud. &#x201c;Where I&#x2019;m from, it isn&#x2019;t unusual for churchgoers to turn to my grandmother for herbs and charms. But I haven&#x2019;t run into this sort of overlap here in San Francisco.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos stood. &#x201c;People are people, Lily. They&#x2019;re not all that different no matter where they live. Listen, I have a quick errand to run. Why don&#x2019;t I pick you up in, say, half an hour?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could meet you at the shop if that&#x2019;s easier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be better, thanks. <i>El Pajarito</i>, on Mission near Twenty-second.&#x201d; He checked his wristwatch, a sporty model with lots of knobs. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make it an hour, to be on the safe side. And Lily: if you get there first, don&#x2019;t go in without me.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can tell. I won&#x2019;t go in without you.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave me another suspicious look.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;All this easy cooperation is making me nervous. Tell me you&#x2019;re not blowin&#x2019; smoke up my caboose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not even sure how to do such a thing,&#x201d; I laughed. &#x201c;I told you: I&#x2019;m resigned to my fate. But I do have one last question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since I&#x2019;m the SFPD&#x2019;s official paranormal consultant, do I get dental with that?&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos flashed me a bright white smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re official only in my book. If the department knew I was bringing in a witch to consult on this case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, let&#x2019;s just say I put up with enough ribbing from my colleagues as it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlos drew aside the curtain. Folks were milling about, crowding the ai...</p></p><h2>The Devouring (A Billy Boyle WWII Mystery)</h2><p><b><b>A murder in wartime Switzerland reveals Swiss complicity with the Nazis in World War II, and US Army detective Billy Boyle is called to investigate.</b><br><br></b>Europe, 1944: Captain Billy Boyle and his friend Lieutenant Piotr &#x201c;Kaz&#x201d; Kazimierz are sent to neutral Switzerland to work with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), investigating Swiss banks that are laundering looted Nazi gold. The US and Swiss governments are about to embark on diplomatic discussions regarding the Safehaven Protocols, aimed at limiting the amount of war materials exported by Switzerland to the Nazis, stemming the tide of looted gold, and preventing postwar use of Nazi wealth by war criminals. With the talks about to begin and the Gestapo ever present, the OSS wants Billy and Kaz to protect the participants, which turns out to be a very deadly task.<br><br>The plans go wrong from the beginning when Billy and Kaz crashland in France. As they make their way through occupied territory to the border, they meet Anton Lasho, a member of the Sinti ethnic group, whose family was slaughtered by the Nazis, and who is, in turn, a one-man Nazi-killing machine. They&#x2019;ll need his help, because as they find once they make it across the border, Swiss banks are openly laundering gold &#x201c;harvested&#x201d; from concentration camps, and those who are profiting will do everything they can to protect their wealth and hide their dark secrets.</p><p>James R. Benn is the author of the Billy Boyle World War II mysteries. The debut,<i> Billy Boyle</i>, was named one of five top mysteries of 2006 by Book Sense and was a Dilys Award nominee. <i>A Blind Goddess</i> was longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and <i>The Rest Is Silence</i> was a Barry Award nominee.

Even as tracers lit the night air, their silent silvery phosphorescence clawing at our small aircraft from the ground below, a tiny part of my brain mused on this practical demonstration of that scientific fact. The rest of my brain panicked madly, sending surges of adrenaline coursing through my body, urging me to get the hell out, now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was not at all helpful, given that we were flying at five hundred feet, heading directly into heavy antiaircraft fire, making one hundred and eighty miles per hour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the sound. The chattering of ack-ack fire. Flak exploding in blinding flashes all around us. Shrapnel struck the aircraft, rending the metal, sounding like the devil&#x2019;s own hail storm on a sheetmetal roof.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hold tight!&#x201d; shouted the pilot as he dove the Lysander and put it through twists and turns to evade the lead rising up against us. I looked below as he dipped the airplane and saw the twinkling of automatic fire from along the stretch of river we&#x2019;d been ollowing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the road,&#x201d; I shouted to the pilot in the single front seat. It was a column of German vehicles, moving at night to avoid Allied aircraft, and we&#x2019;d flown dead at them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot didn&#x2019;t waste breath answering. He banked left, violently, diving to treetop level at a right angle away from the river. Looking back, I saw tracer fire searching vainly for us, then fade as the Krauts gave up and continued on their way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lysander jolted, loud <i>thump</i>s whacking against the aircraft frame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry, chaps,&#x201d; the pilot muttered, pulling back on the yoke and gaining altitude. &#x201c;Almost landed in the pines. She&#x2019;s a bit sluggish, might&#x2019;ve caught some shrapnel in the rudder.&#x201d; He banked the Lysander, bringing us around to the river again, the only map to our destination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There may be other columns on the road,&#x201d; Kaz said, adjusting his steel-rimmed spectacles. Even after nearly being blown out of the sky and tossed around inside the cramped Lysander, he managed to sound nonchalant, his precise English leavened with the slightest of Polish accents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Sa�ne River is our only landmark,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Jerry&#x2019;s travel plans notwithstanding. If we veer off to the east, we run the risk of entering Swiss airspace. It&#x2019;d be damned embarrassing to be shot down by the Swiss, after all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Kaz asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know the Swiss. Chocolate, watches, and sheep, that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re famous for. I&#x2019;d never hear the end of it, if I lived to tell the tale.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Personally, I&#x2019;d choose death by chocolatier if I had any say in the matter,&#x201d; Kaz responded. Switzerland was our ultimate destination, and we weren&#x2019;t in the market for wristwatches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about the Swiss or the Jerries,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t lost a Joe yet, and I don&#x2019;t plan on starting tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were his Joes. It was what the Special Operations Executive pilots called the agents and commandoes they flew into occupied Europe. No names, nothing to reveal if captured and tortured, just an anonymous one-way ride to some grassy field in the countryside. In a few minutes we were back on course, flying low over dark hills and a glistening waterway, the bright half-moon at our backs providing a tempting target for alert Kraut gunners, the river our only guide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the next landmark?&#x201d; I asked the nameless pilot. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll bear left at the Rh�ne River in Lyon. There&#x2019;s a sharp bend in the river, it&#x2019;ll be easy to spot, even with only a half-moon. Then Lake Gris, a narrow lake about twelve miles long. I set us down outside of Cessens, in a nice open field on a ridge overlooking the water. A bit tricky, but very secluded.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tricky I didn&#x2019;t mind, if it meant no Krauts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We flew on, no sign of movement below us, not a single light visible in the blacked-out countryside. The drone of the engine was mesmerizing, lulling us into a sense of security and safety, the sudden, surprising bright barrage of fire now behind us. The high, clear canopy gave us a majestic view of the sparkling heavens. The&nbsp; half-moon, the stars, and the faint glow from the instrument panel our only illuminations, guiding us as we traveled across a calm sea of inky black.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost relaxed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Kaz asked, leaning forward and pointing at two o&#x2019;clock. Searchlights flickered in the distance, an orange glow growing at the horizon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bloody Bomber Command most likely,&#x201d; the pilot answered in a low growl. &#x201c;Hitting the rail yards in Lyon. Or the airfield west of the city. Either way, they&#x2019;ve stirred up a hornet&#x2019;s nest for us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can we go around it?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the fuel. We&#x2019;re at the extreme range as it is. I topped off at a forward airstrip in Normandy, but I&#x2019;ve barely enough to make it back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We must fly through that?&#x201d; Kaz asked. As we drew closer, the night sky grew brighter with searchlights, explosions, and burning buildings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Unless you Joes want to abort the mission. Say the word and I&#x2019;ll turn around.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have you ever had to abort?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No. Thought I&#x2019;d offer, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; he said, turning to smile at us. SOE pilot humor, I guess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as bad as it looks, mates. We&#x2019;re under their radar, and the Jerries are looking for high-altitude bombers, not our little Lysander.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fly under the bomber formation,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;Being hit by an RAF bomb would be more embarrassing than being shot down by the Swiss.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right you are,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Now all we need to do is catch a glimpse of the Rh�ne River. It&#x2019;ll be even easier with the sky all lit up. Jerry&#x2019;s doing us a favor!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was one way of looking at it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drew closer to the city, the searchlights casting wide beams of white light, looking like columns holding up the night sky. Phosphorescent tracer bullets sought out the bombers, dancing against the darkness in graceful, deadly arcs. Bombs exploded in front of us, maybe a quarter of a mile away. The pilot banked the Lysander, moving away rom the flames and smoke. The aircraft shook as shock waves from the explosions buffeted us, sending the plane into a sideways dive. The ground looked damned close.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hang on,&#x201d; the pilot told us, as if we hadn&#x2019;t already figured that one out. He pulled the small craft up, his voice a nervous quiver he couldn&#x2019;t quite hide. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the main rail yard. We should be fine now. Look, there&#x2019;s the river.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Rh�ne, heading west from the burning city, shimmering with moonlight and mayhem, antiaircraft fire dying down as the bomber stream departed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is the airplane damaged?&#x201d; Kaz asked. There was a metallic rattle coming from the fuselage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s banged up,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;But I can hold her steady, don&#x2019;t worry. The good news is I can cut some time off our trip and make sure you chaps get to Cessens. The Rh�ne meanders a good bit, so I&#x2019;ll cut across the bends heading ninety degrees west. That&#x2019;ll bring us to Lake Gris all the quicker.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the bad news?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It will bring us close to a Luftwaffe airfield. Sounds worse than it is, really. Any night fighters they have left will be airborne, going after the bombers. We&#x2019;ll scoot right by. You should be on the ground in thirty minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So the airfield poses no danger?&#x201d; Kaz asked, his tone skeptical.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right. Long as one of the flak batteries doesn&#x2019;t open up on us. So, once again, hang on.&#x201d; He increased speed and lost altitude, skimming the treetops until we found ourselves over open fields. It felt as if he were going in for a landing at two hundred miles an hour. The rattle clanged even faster, the fuselage shuddering as we raced for the next bend in the river.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Airfield coming up on the right,&#x201d; the pilot informed us through clenched teeth as he held the yoke firmly in his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There,&#x201d; Kaz said, pointing to black shapes that were probably hangers. The landscape zipped by underneath us, and we were nearly clear, about to leave the blacked-out airfield behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the sky lit up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Searchlights, some only a few hundred yards away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright explosions ripped into the blackness ahead, followed by a series of blasts falling across our path. I lifted my hands to shield my eyes as one of the beams caught us, sending blinding white light into the canopy. More explosions sounded as the pilot climbed, seeking to escape the clutches of the searchlight and the antiaircraft fire it would soon bring to bear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concussions from the bombs hit us, shaking the Lysander, dragging it through the sky as if it were a kite on a string. We&#x2019;d guessed wrong. The bombers were targeting both the rail yards and the airfield.<br>We&#x2019;d flown straight into the second raid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light found us again, staying with the Lysander even as the pilot gave up on altitude and put the nose down, hoping to shake the flak. Tracers burned the night sky, hitting us in the wing, shearing metal, and sending us into a spin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The searchlight lost us. I grabbed onto my seat and Kaz&#x2019;s arm, hoping the pilot could steady the aircraft. I braced for impact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn&#x2019;t come. The sturdy Lysander managed to fly straight, so low we could&#x2019;ve been hit by a well-thrown stone. I craned my neck to see behind us, the orange glow of flames and the white searchlights fading in the distance. Wind whistled through a bullet hole in the canopy, the clanging rattle of metal still sounding from within the fuselage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The aircraft is damaged,&#x201d; Kaz said, as calmly as he might observe that it may well rain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll get you there, don&#x2019;t you worry,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Although getting me back home is another thing altogether.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You are welcome to join us, if you wish,&#x201d; Kaz said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in the cards, Joe. The Germans would love to get their hands on a Lysander. I&#x2019;ll stay with the plane until you&#x2019;re safely away and then put the torch to her. Maybe I&#x2019;ll get lucky and spend the rest of the war learning French from a farmer&#x2019;s daughter, if Jerry doesn&#x2019;t catch me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. I felt bad for him, but at the same time I was glad he didn&#x2019;t take Kaz up on the invite. Things would be tough enough without an extra man along. If he was lucky, our Resistance contacts would leave somebody with him. But we had places to go, and fast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est la guerre,&#x201d; </i>he answered, the yoke vibrating violently in his<br>hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A harsh knock came from the engine, followed by a metal-onmetal grating. The propeller stopped. Oil sprayed the windscreen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh shit,&#x201d; the pilot said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lysander dropped from the sky.</p><h2>Our Reasonable Faith</h2><p>This popular digest of Herman Bavinck&#39;s classic four-volume Reformed Dogmatics clearly presents the fundamental doctrines of biblical theology.

For others, translation is the royal road to cross-cultural understanding and literary enrichment. In this nuanced and provocative study, Mark Polizzotti attempts to reframe the debate along more fruitful lines. Eschewing both these easy polarities and the increasingly abstract discourse of translation theory, he brings the main questions into clearer focus: What is the ultimate goal of a translation? What does it mean to label a rendering &#x201c;faithful&#x201d;? (Faithful to what?) Is something inevitably lost in translation, and can something also be gained? <i>Does</i> translation matter, and if so, why? Unashamedly opinionated, both a manual and a manifesto, his book invites usto sympathize with the translator not as a &#x201c;traitor&#x201d; but as the author's creative partner.</p><p>Polizzotti, himself a translator of authors from Patrick Modiano to Gustave Flaubert, explores what translation is and what it isn't, and how it does or doesn't work. Translation, he writes, &#x201c;skirts the boundaries between art and craft, originality and replication, altruism and commerce, genius and hack work.&#x201d; In <i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i>, he shows us how to read not only translations but also the act of translation itself, treating it not as a problem to be solved but as an achievement to be celebrated&#x2015;something, as Goethe put it, &#x201c;impossible, necessary, and important.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Mark Polizzotti has translated more than fifty books, including works by Patrick Modiano, Gustave Flaubert, Raymond Roussel, Marguerite Duras, and Paul Virilio. Publisher and Editor-in-Chief at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he is also the author of <i>Revolution of the Mind: The Life of Andr� Breton </i>and other books.<p>Lively, readable, and often funny ... a likably idiosyncratic sequence of essays on a topic that is of more importance than ever in our globalized world ... Polizzotti makes one feel that creating and reading translated literature can be a genuinely pleasurable experience.</p>&#x2015;<b>Emily Wilson</b>, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br><p><i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i> is lucid and erudite, but above all it is engaging, entertaining and illuminating ... as exhilarating and invigorating as a lungful of chill, pure air in a classroom grown musty with dogma.</p>&#x2015;<b>Frank Wynne</b>, <i>THE SPECTATOR</i><br><br><p>With impressive breadth and scrupulous detail, translator Polizzotti offers a manifesto about what translation is, what it should be, and why it is important ... Polizzotti's book is suffused with expertise and displays his decades of experience in incisively capturing the nuances of an esoteric discipline, while also offering a passionate defense of his trade's larger value.</p>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><p>There is no such thing as a perfect translation, claims Polizzotti, adding: &#x201c;And so much the better.&#x201d; Translation deserves to join other forms of artistic expression on its own terms, but the process should &#x201c;start in homes and in schools.&#x201d; This book has the potential to inspire such a change.</p>&#x2015;<b>Anna Aslanyan</b>, <i>Financial Times</i><br><br><p><i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i> is lucid and erudite, but above all it is engaging, entertaining and illuminating and Polizzotti's manifesto is as exhilarating and invigorating as a lungful of chill, pure air in a classroom grown musty with dogma. He eschews the dour fingerwagging that translation is somehow 'good for us', as though it were literary cod-liver oil, and revels instead in those voices that offer 'a particular delight, an irreplaceable thrill of discovery that is available nowhere else'. As he persuasively argues: if literature in translation is valuable in today's world, it is because such minds and voices are exceedingly rare, and we cannot afford to be ignorant of a single one of them.</p>&#x2015;<i>New Statesman</i><br><br><p>In&nbsp;<i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i>, his&nbsp;acute, pugnacious manifesto, Mark Polizzotti takes issue with the adage&nbsp;traduttore traditore: translators aren't traducers or traitors, ghosts or parrots, or helpmeets, but writers in their own write (as John Lennon put it). The longstanding ideal of the good translator's self-effacement behind the towering original fails to take full measure of their vital role in recognising their parity with the author: 'It takes respect for one's own work,' Polizzotti writes, 'belief that one's translation is worth judging on its own merits (or flaws), and that, if done properly, it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the source text.'</p>&#x2015;<i>London Review of Books</i><br><br><p>To Polizzotti, a translator deserves notice as an artist, no matter how hidden her art may be. The ability to hide one's voice is an art, and it's one readers should learn to look for. In other words, Polizzotti asks readers not to suspend belief, but to catch ourselves in the act of believing.</p>&#x2015;<i>Public Books</i></p><h2>Why Government Can&#39;t Save You An Alternative To Political Activism</h2><p><p>The Lord did not come as a political deliverer or social reformer.

The seven stories in this excellent collection demonstrate the author's ability to create memorable tales on themes of love and marriage, divorce, the experience of the artist, high society and its workings and other topics.<br>"Souls Belated," a tragedy of mores, focuses on characters overcome by the demands of convention, while "The Pelican" and "The Muse's Tragedy" both present women whose realities differ from their public personae. "Expiation" is a satiric, revealing story about the publishing industry, featuring a writer determined to increase the sales of her first novel. In "The Dilettante," a young man who prides himself on his ability to manipulate women must face ironic consequences when he introduces his fianc�e to his supposed lover. "Xingu" is a witty satire on the intellectual pretensions of a group of rich women, while "The Other Two" presents a darkly humorous look at the consequences of divorce.<br>Gathered in this inexpensive volume, these stories provide an excellent sampling of Wharton's masterly efforts in the short story genre, a form of fiction she felt especially suited to her talents and one that enabled her to achieve a focused and intimate realism.</p><p></p><h2>Harry Dee: Or Working it Out</h2><p>Young Harry Dee arrives at St. Maure&#39;s thin and pale from his painful experiences involving the murder of his rich uncle.

When the sale of an old tractor brings in a windfall, Mr. Moore resolves to buy a present for her tenth birthday. They come away from the weekly horse auction, however, with a skinny, mangy-looking old mare, not the young steed Molly has always envisioned.

In the fevered religious atmosphere, heightened by the first massed use of artillery bombardment, both sides feared that the end of the world was nigh.<br><br>The outcome of the siege, decided in a few short hours on 29 May 1453, is one of the great set-piece moments of world history.</p><p>Roger Crowley read English at Cambridge. He has had a varied career as a teacher and publisher and is the author of three books on the history of the Mediterranean. He lives in Gloucestershire and now writes full time. His website address is www.rogercrowley.co.ukOn May 29, 1453, Ottoman forces, under the leadership of Mehmet II, concluded their long and bloody siege of Constantinople by storming the city and overtaking it. According to Crowley, who works in publishing in England;the Ottoman conquest of the city brought to an end centuries of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and Islam. In overwhelming detail and colorless prose, Crowley chronicles the story of an ancient city and its attraction to members of two major religions. Before Mehmet's conquest, Constantinople had faced various unsuccessful sieges, and Crowley faithfully records them. The most destructive events came between 1341 and 1371, when earthquakes and the Black Death devastated the city, turning it into a forlorn series of villages. Although the Byzantine capital recovered enough of its former glory to entice Mehmet to its walls, even he felt tremendous disappointment, finding the city didn't live up to its reputation. Crowley drones through the day-by-day events of Mehmet's siege and the results of the conquest. Perhaps the author's most instructive point, made by others as well, is that Mehmet turned the city into one where religious toleration and multiculturalism flourished. <i>(Aug. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

S. Army Captain Craig Mullaney recounts his unparalleled education and the hard lessons that only war can teach. While stationed in Afghanistan, a deadly firefight with al-Qaeda leads to the loss of one of his soldiers. Years later, after that excruciating experience, he returns to the United States to teach future officers at the Naval Academy. Written with unflinching honesty, this is an unforgettable portrait of a young soldier grappling with the weight of war while coming to terms with what it means to be a man. <p> </p></p><p>Craig Mullaney grew up in a blue-collar, Irish-Catholic family in Rhode Island and graduated from West Point in 2000. An Airborne Ranger, Mullaney earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. In 2003, he led an infantry rifle platoon along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. His platoon operated along the entire spectrum of operations&#x2014;from humanitarian assistance to combat engagements against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. Mullaney was later selected to join the Old Guard, the Army's elite honor guard for Arlington National Cemetery. He served three years on the history faculty of the U.S. Naval Academy, focusing on the history of American foreign policy. Mullaney&#x2019;s military awards include the Combat Infantryman&#x2019;s Badge, Bronze Star Medal, and Army Commendation Medal with &#x201c;V&#x201d; device for valor. He was an adviser on the Obama-Biden campaign and is now a member of the President-elect's Transition Team.In simple but intelligent language, an Army officer shares his physical and mentally maturing experiences at West Point and Army Ranger school. Listeners can decide if those lessons in obedience, discipline, and conformity prepared him for leadership as a platoon leader in Afghanistan. Todd McLaren adapts his narration to the situations Mullaney describes. He assumes a raspy, gruff voice for orders from the Lieutenant&#39;s superiors and a somber one for occasional introspective moments. McLaren&#39;s subtle treatment avoids exaggeration while preserving the emotional moods the author intended for his memories of romance, combat, and death. McLaren capitalizes on the author&#39;s military brevity in describing war and captures his softer side as Shakespearian poetry punctuates his recollections of courting his wife during postgraduate study at Oxford.

Strategies for Handling Your Fast-Paced Life</h2><p>Look at what's happened to the usual how-are-you exchange. It used to go like this: "How are you?" "Fine." Now it often goes like this: "How are you?" "Busy." Or "Too busy." Or simply "Crazy."<br><br>Without intending for it to happen or knowing how, when, or why it got started, many people now find that they live in a rush they never wanted. If you feel busier than you've ever been and wonder how this happened and how you can keep up the pace much longer, you are hardly alone. <br><br>Crazy? Maybe not. Dysfunctional? Yes, indeed. We all have more to do than ever before -- and less time to do it. In this highly listenable audiobook, the foremost expert on ADD, Ned Hallowell, explores the society-wide phenomenon of culturally induced ADD. <br><br>Being busy may very well keep you from doing what matters most, or it may lead you to do things you deem unwise (like getting angry, for example). Being busy is a problem for almost all of us. This audiobook is about both the opportunity and the problem -- where this peculiar life comes from and how to turn it to your advantage. Offering solutions to this difficult, complex problem that might work for you, most importantly, <i>Crazybusy</i> may prompt you to create solutions of your own.</p><p><b>Edward M.

The cottage was so remote that there was no cell phone service, just the stolid black telephone sitting atop a tattered phone book on an end table next to a worn-out peach-colored couch.<br><br> I remember the first time I dialed that phone. It was morning. I&#x2019;d gone out for a wake-me-up swim, poured myself a cup of coffee, and was sitting on the couch to call a friend to see if he and his kids might like to join my wife, my kids, and me that night at a minor league baseball game. There was no urgency to this call, no need for me to hurry.<br><br> Yet as I started to dial, got angry, and impatience flamed within me because on this phone I had to wait for the rotor to wind back to its starting point after each number. It was so slow! In addition, it made an irritating screeching sound as it retraced its cycle, like a rusty metal drawer stuck on its runners: 5 . . . 4 . . . 2 . . . 6 . . . I could have entered the entire number on a touch-tone phone in the time it took me to dial just one number on this obsolete contraption. Not to mention how much faster I could have done it with speed dial had I been able to use my cell phone.<br><br> By the time I had laboriously cranked out the entire number, I was in a total snit. How could anyone still own such a slow phone? I fumed. What a stupid phone! How backward! How dumb! But then I caught myself. This was absurd. When my friend finally answered, I spoke to him, hung up, and then redialed his number, timing how long it took me: eleven seconds exactly. As if putting my life in danger, those eleven slow seconds had annoyed me beyond reason. What a fool I had become. What a modern man. I felt embarrassed at my automatic impatience. I had become a man in a hurry even when I had no need to hurry.<br><br> As the vacation moved along, I changed. I made friends with that old rotary phone. I began to appreciate what it could teach me. The sound it made started to sound less like a stuck drawer and more like an old windmill still stoutly doing its work after all these years. I came to think of it as a wise counsel, ensconced on its end table like a Buddha cautioning me to take my time and enjoy, while they lasted, the summer, the childhood of my kids, the ripening of my marriage, and these best years of my life.<br><br> Without intending for it to happen or knowing how it got started, many people now find that they live in a rush they don&#x2019;t want and didn&#x2019;t create, or at least didn&#x2019;t mean to create. If you feel busier now than you&#x2019;ve ever been before, and if you wonder if you can keep up this pace much longer, don&#x2019;t feel alone. Most of us feel slightly bewildered, realizing we have more to do than ever&#x2014;with less time to do it.<br><br> Look at what&#x2019;s happened to the usual &#x201c;how are you&#x201d; exchange. It used to go like this: &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Now it often goes like this: &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Busy.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Too busy.&#x201d; Or even, &#x201c;Crazy busy.&#x201d;<br><br> If you&#x2019;re busy doing what matters to you, then being busy is bliss. You&#x2019;ve found a rhythm for your life that works for you. This world is bursting with possibilities; its energy can be contagious. If you catch the bug, you want to jump out of bed each day and get busy, not because you are run ragged by details or because you are keeping the wolf from your door, but because you are in love with this fast life. At its best, modern life dazzles us, giving us a chance to get more done in a minute than used to get done in a month.<br><br> But if being busy keeps you from doing what matters most to you, or if it leads you to do things you deem unwise, like getting angry at a rotary telephone, then being busy is a problem. This book is about both the problem and the opportunity&#x2014;where this peculiar life comes from and how to turn it to your advantage.<br><br> In order to make this crazy world work for you and not against you, you must decide what matters to you most and focus your attention on that. In days gone by, this was not nearly as difficult as it is today. That&#x2019;s because the selection was not nearly as broad, and the thieves of time, attention, and mental energy were not nearly as common or as clever as they are today. Today, these thieves have never had it so good. If you&#x2019;re not wise to their tricks, it is likely that they will run you faster and faster as they steal more and more of your time, attention, and energy, leaving you less and less for what you want to do.<br><br> Being too busy, which can seem necessary and unavoidable, can become a habit so entrenched that it leads you to postpone or cut short what really matters to you, making you a slave to a lifestyle you don&#x2019;t like but can&#x2019;t escape. You can be so busy that you don&#x2019;t even take the time to decide what actually does matter most to you, let alone make the time to do it.<br><br> Others created this lifestyle. It looked like the only way to go, the way of the future. What were you supposed to do, be a Luddite and refuse to buy a cell phone or a BlackBerry? Not go wireless? Refuse to enroll your kids in soccer, violin, and SAT tutoring? Refuse to take on the added debt of the extra week of vacation your spouse and kids were counting on? Have simple birthday parties the way they used to in the 1950s and 1960s? Figure out a way to live with just one car? Or just two? Say no to braces for your daughter? Let your yard go to seed? Refuse to give your time to the cancer foundation your friend is heading up? Refuse to do the extra work your boss asks you to do because half your staff got laid off? What if you&#x2019;re next?<br><br> Unaware of the hidden consequences, and without making a conscious decision to do so, soon you found that you and your family had joined right in. It happened slowly, over the past five to ten years. Had you known then what you know now, you might have done things differently. It is like the story of frogs in water. If you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, he will try to jump out. But if you put a frog in a pot of cold water and heat it up slowly, you will end up with a boiled frog.<br><br> Someone turned up the burner on us in the mid-1990s. We&#x2019;re not boiled yet, but we&#x2019;re definitely feeling the heat. Before the water boils, it might be a good idea to jump out. Not jump out of modern life and head off to Walden Pond (though even it swarms with busy tourists), but adjust the temperature yourself instead of letting some diabolical chef set it for you.<br><br> The greatest damage from being too busy is that it prevents people from setting their own temperature, controlling their own lives. It does other harm as well, like increasing toxic stress, making people sick, causing accidents and errors, turning otherwise polite people rude, and reducing the general level of happiness in the population. But the greatest damage it does is that it keeps a person from what&#x2019;s most important.<br><br> Being too busy is a persistent and pestering problem, one that is leading tens of millions of Americans to feel as if they were living in a swarm of gnats constantly taking bites out of their lives. All the screaming and swatting in the world does not make them go away. Being too busy plagues the best and brightest people in this country, if not the world. Legions of smart people everywhere feel overly busy; they rack their brains to find a better way, struggling to regain control of their lives. I want to explore this difficult problem, offer some solutions that can work for you, and most important, prompt you to create your own solutions.</p><h2>Teasing Annie (The Temptation Saga, 2)</h2><p>Newly divorced from his greedy and deceptive first wife, Dallas McCray is convinced he wants a sweet country girl like his sister-in-law.

The Truth!</h2><p>In October 2017 Stephen Kotkin, professor of history at Princeton University, published "Stalin. Waiting for Hitler, 1929 &#x2013; 1941." In it, Kotkin accuses Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of dozens of terrible crimes and atrocities.The appearance of Kotkin&#x2019;s scholarship is daunting: 909 pages of text, more than 5200 footnotes, and 47 pages of bibliography in tiny, triple-column type. But Grover Furr has carefully and methodically studied every one of the hundreds of allegations of atrocity, crime, and misdeeds of any kind that Kotkin attributes to Stalin and his closest advisers. Furr has checked every reference, every article and book, that Kotkin cites as evidence. The result: Furr has found that every single "crime" Kotkin alleges is false - a fabrication. Not a single accusation holds up. On the evidence, Stalin committed NO crime, no atrocities &#x2013; for if he had, Kotkin would surely have uncovered at least one. Furr&#x2019;s exhaustive research shows that Soviet history of the 1930s, has been falsified. Furr&#x2019;s book is a model of meticulous examination of evidence and careful, objective analysis and deduction."Stalin. Waiting For ... The Truth" exposes the lies and falsehoods behind Soviet history of the 1930s with the same meticulous attention to detail as his previous works: "Khrushchev Lied" (2011), "The Murder of Sergei Kirov" (2013), "Blood Lies" (2014), "Trotsky&#x2019;s &#x2018;Amalgams&#x2019;" (2015), "Yezhov vs. Stalin" (2016), "Leon Trotsky&#x2019;s Collaboration with Germany and Japan" (2017), and "The Mystery of the Katyn Massacre; The Evidence, The Solution" (2018).</p><p></p><h2>This Terrible Sound: The Battle of Chickamauga (Civil War Trilogy)</h2><p>Renders the furious ebb and flow of the two-day battle, capturing both the evolving strategies of each side and the horrendous experience of the fight. This book draws from hundreds of diaries, letters, memoirs, interviews, official reports, and regimental histories.</p><p>Selected by <i>Civil War Magazine</i> as one of the 100 essential titles on military campaigns and personalities<br> &nbsp;When North and South met among the desolate mountains of northwestern Georgia in 1863, they began one of the bloodiest and most decisive campaigns of the Civil War. The climactic Battle of Chickamauga lasted just two days, yet it was nearly as costly as Gettysburg, with casualties among the highest in the war. In this study of the campaign, the first to appear in over thirty years and the most comprehensive account ever written on Chickamauga, Peter Cozzens presents a vivid narrative about an engagement that was crucial to the outcome of the war in the West. Drawing upon a wealth of previously untapped sources, Cozzens offers startling new interpretations that challenge the conventional wisdom on key moments of the battle, such as Rosecrans&#39;s fateful order to General Wood and Thomas&#39;s historic defense of Horseshoe Ridge. Chickamauga was a battle of missed opportunities, stupendous tactical blunders, and savage fighting by the men in ranks. Cozzens writes movingly of both the heroism and suffering of the common soldiers and of the strengths and tragic flaws of their commanders. Enhanced by detailed battle maps and original sketches by the noted artist Keith Rocco, this book will appeal to all Civil War enthusiasts and students of military history.</p><h2>Pilgrim Souls: A Collection of Spiritual Autobiography</h2><p>What is the source of personal writing? When do we begin to consider our own lives worthy of a story? These powerful and passionate selections of spiritual autobiography do not merely represent a vital literary tradition; they bring together fifty-eight writers whose search for truth and understanding has spanned over two millennia and several continents. <br> From Saint Augustine and Rabi'a to T. S. Eliot and Kathleen Norris, each of these autobiographers tells the story of the inner life as a spiritual quest. Although separated culturally, historically, and linguistically, they are united by their efforts to respond to Socrates' challenge to "know thyself." In four parts this insightful collection includes works by: <br> * Wanderers and seekers, like Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Merton, who feverishly explore many experiences and world views<br> * Pilgrims and missionaries, like Anne Bradstreet and David Livingstone, who unwaveringly pursue God and holiness in lives of self-sacrifice<br> * Mystics and visionaries, like Julian of Norwich and Annie Dillard, who discover the ecstasy of epiphany in a life of contemplation and seclusion<br> * Scholars and philosophers, like Simone Weil and Blaise Pascal, who seek to ground spiritual conviction in a rational certitude. <br> Strong, deep, and enduring, the selections in this illuminating anthology remind us that "the unexamined life is not worth living" and speak to us with an immediacy that transcends time and space.</p><p>This anthology is broken down into the four basic categories of spiritual journeys, according to the editors. 1) Wanderers and seekers--those who pursue "all available experiences under the sun." 2) Pilgrims and missionaries--"individuals whose life goal has been the unwavering pursuit of God." 3) Mystics and visionaries--"who focus on supernatural experiences and epiphanies." 4) Philosophers and scholars--those who "demonstrate a lifelong commitment to the discernment of the truth through the exercise of the intellect."<p> By organizing spiritual quests into these themes, the authors create an effect that is more liberating than confining, offering a clear context for the sometimes ethereal and wrenching stories of real-life saints, rabbis, writers, and pilgrims from all walks of life. Literary heroes add their impassioned and tender stories of spiritual transformation, whether it be Leo Tolstoy's excerpt from <i>The Confession</i>, Madeleine L'Engle's self-revealing story of forgiveness and the sensuality of the human body, or Annie Dillard's tug of war with a loving God who allows terrible things to happen to good people. Spiritual seekers will no doubt find their own stories in this stimulating and expansive dedication to the soul's eternal pilgrimage. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Madeleine L'Engle</b> is best known for her science fiction trilogy <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> winner of the Newbery Award; <i>A Wind in the Door;</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award.

But it's not magic wands that dictate the new characters' skills &#x2014;it's coding. Hopper, an enthusiastic 12-year-old girl (named after programmer Grace Hopper), has just started school at the creepy Stately Academy. After getting in a fight that involves "lung pudding" (a loogie!) with Eni (based on NBA star Chris Bosh), Hopper and Eni become friends while unraveling the secrets of the school. Robotic birds, family troubles, and sinister, child-hating school administrators lead to a story both emotionally rich and rife with learning opportunities. Readers will feel themselves thinking in a new way as they watch Hopper and Eni transform into coders on a mission, but the story never feels pedantic. The graphic novel format is effective and will appeal to everyone from computer lovers to reluctant readers to mystery fans. The black and green art is effective and straightforward, and the pacing of the panels is excellent. The book is important in light of issues of diversity in the computer programming world; Hopper is biracial, and Eni is African American, and both have multiple dimensions to their characters (they are more than just computer nerds). This first volume ends on a cliff-hanger with real life magic: the magic of coding made accessible. VERDICT An excellent first purchase that introduces readers to the power of computer programming through an engaging graphic mystery.&#x2014;Lisa Nowlain, Darien Library, CT</p><h2>Autoharp Owner&#39;s Manual</h2><p>The Autoharp Owner&#x2019;s Manual covers autoharp maintenance, conversions, tuning and string schedules (both diatonic and chromatic), building your own instrument, playing techniques, evaluating instruments, chord bar setups, amplification, history, and much more.

Given its pioneering role as a jet bomber and the ongoing evolution of SAC's mission and US national security, the B-47 had more than its share of teething problems. </p><p>Initial Boeing flight tests mixed triumph with tragedy, and demonstrated that an entirely new way of flying a large aircraft was required. Poor reliability in the bombing-navigation and fire-control systems undermined the effectiveness of early B-47Bs but were eventually overcome as the aircraft evolved to fill many different roles. </p><p>Used as reconnaissance, weather, testbed and radio relay platforms, one variant, the EB-47E BLUE CRADLE, also demonstrated its versatility as an electronic warfare jammer while the RB-47H, ERB-47H, and EB-47E(TT) undertook electronic intelligence and gathered telemetry associated with the Soviet ICBM program. </p><p>Authors Mike Habermehl and former SAC pilot Robert S. Hopkins III have combined years of research and experience to provide the ultimate history of the Stratojet.</p></p><p>At the onset of the Cold War, an American jet-powered bomber seemed to be the optimal choice to carry atomic bombs in any attack on the Soviet Union. After a brief competition, Strategic Air Command chose the Boeing B-47 Stratojet which flew higher and was faster than all but supersonic fighters. However, despite the experience gained from building B-17s and B-29s during the Second World War, Boeing was ill prepared for the complexities of B-47 production and hundreds of B-47s were delivered without functional bombing, navigation, and defensive systems, rendering them little more than daylight, good weather shortrange bombers for use against undefended targets. <p>This is the extraordinary story of how the B-47 made the successful transition from an aircraft that was little more than an aerodynamic experiment into a medium bomber that formed the backbone of SAC&#x2019;s nuclear strike force. B-47 operations were at the forefront of early electronic warfare capabilities, were instrumental in developing tactics for low-level strikes and provided a critical communications link between ground headquarters and the famous "Looking Glass KC-135B." Reconnaissance variants of the B-47 conducted routine, if not hazardous, peripheral intelligence missions around the Soviet Union including 156 sorties during Operation Home Run.

His first story is about Clare Kemplay, a young girl recently found brutally murdered. While the police department and other crime reporters at the newspaper believe it's an isolated incident, Eddie finds a pattern between Clare's disappearance and those of other girls from a few years earlier. Despite his better judgment, and against the advice of others, he starts to dig deep. What he finds is a nightmare of corruption, violence, blackmail, and obsession that ultimately leads to a shocking, explosive conclusion.</p><p>From the very first page of David Peace's first novel, <i>1974</i>, it soon becomes clear that something is rotten in the state of Yorkshire: a young girl is missing. The <i>Yorkshire Post</i>'s young but disillusioned crime correspondent, Edward Dunford, is assigned to the story, while also coping with the recent death of his father and his return to his native Yorkshire after a brief and unsuccessful stint in Fleet Street. For the jaded Dunford, it's just another story; the only intrigue is whether the girl will be found dead or alive before Christmas--that is, until she is discovered brutally murdered, face down in a ditch with a pair of swan's wings sewn into her back. As Dunford follows the case, he begins to make a series of terrifying connections with a string of child murders, plunging him into a gut-wrenching nightmare of corruption, violence, sadism, blackmail, and sexual obsession--from the upper echelons of local government to the tacky heart of Yorkshire darkness. <p> As Peace's tale of corruption and conspiracy unravels, it becomes clear that <i>1974</i> is as influenced by Orwell's own bleak vision of Britain in <i>1984</i> as it is by the wonderfully evoked atmosphere of the mid '70s. <i>The Bay City Rollers</i>, <i>Leeds United</i>, <i>It Ain't Half Hot Mum</i>, and <i>Vauxhall Viva's</i> all make an appearance. The novel works at several levels, from the brilliantly unsentimental homecoming of the gifted, alienated northern son to a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of an insular, tribal community. The plot is complex and frenetic, and Peace often neglects loose ends, especially as he builds to an extremely powerful climax. Yet the dialogue is fast, witty, and violent; a must-read for fans of Yorkshire Gothic. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p>David Peace is the author of <b>The Red Riding Quartet</b>, <b>GB84</b>,<b>The Damned Utd</b> and <b>Tokyo Year Zero</b>. He was chosen as one of <i>Granta's</i> 2003 Best Young British Novelists, and has received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the German Crime Fiction Award, and the French Grand Prix de Roman Noir for Best Foreign Novel. Born and raised in Yorkshire, he has lived in Tokyo since 1994.</p><h2>Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage (Music in American Life)</h2><p>&nbsp;<br> Leon Theremin led a life of flamboyant musical invention laced with daring electronic stealth. A creative genius and prolific inventor, Theremin launched the field of electronic music virtually singlehandedly in 1920 with the musical instrument that bears his name. The theremin-&#x2013;the only instrument that is played without being touched-&#x2013;created a sensation worldwide and paved the way for the modern synthesizer. Its otherworldly sound became familiar in sci-fi films and even in rock music. This magical instrument that charmed millions, however, is only the beginning of the story.<br> As a Soviet scientist, Theremin surrendered his life and work to the service of State espionage. On assignment in Depression-era America, he became the toast of New York society and worked the engines of capitalist commerce while passing data on U.S. industrial technology to the Soviet apparat. Following his sudden disappearance from New York in 1938, Theremin was&nbsp; exiled to a Siberian labor camp and subsequently vanished into the top-secret Soviet intelligence machine, presumed dead for nearly thirty years. Using the same technology that lay behind the theremin, he designed bugging devices that eavesdropped on U.S. diplomatic offices and stood at the center of a pivotal cold war confrontation. Throughout his life, Theremin developed many other electronic wonders, including one of the earliest televisions and multimedia devices that anticipated performance art and virtual reality by decades.<br> In this first full biography of Leon Theremin, Albert Glinsky depicts the inventor's nearly one hundred-year life span as a microcosm of the twentieth century. Theremin is seen at the epicenter of most of the major events of the century: the Russian Revolution, two world wars, America's Great Depression, Stalin's purges, the cold war, and perestroika. His life emerges as no less than a metaphor for the divergence of communism and capitalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Theremin</i> blends the whimsical and the treacherous into a chronicle that takes in everything from the KGB to Macy's store windows, Alcatraz to the Beach Boys, Hollywood thrillers to the United Nations, Joseph Stalin to Shirley Temple. Theremin's world of espionage and invention is an amazing drama of hidden loyalties, mixed motivations, and an irrepressibly creative spirit.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Albert Glinsky</b> is an award-winning composer whose music has been performed throughout the U.S., Europe, and the Far East. He holds degrees from The Juilliard School and a Ph.D. from New York University, and his work has been honored by the National Endowment for the Arts, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is Composer-in-Residence and Professor of Music at Mercyhurst College in Pennsylvania. <b>Robert Moog</b> developed the original classic Moog electronic music synthesizer and has been designing and building theremins since 1954. Currently he is the president of Moog Music Inc., the world's leading manufacturer of theremins.<br> &nbsp;For this biography, Glinsky admirably resurrects the name of Leon Theremin, the Soviet inventor of an electronic musical instrument played by moving one's hands in the space between two antennae, but his use of Theremin's life as a metaphor for the Cold War leads him astray. An engineering prodigy, Theremin (1896-1993) invented his instrument early in the 20th century. The synthesizer's forerunner, the theremin was most often used in soundtracks for science fiction films; an advanced version was also used in the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations." According to Glinsky, Theremin was also a ladies' manAmarried several times, he was rumored to be looking for female companionship when he was in his 90s. The inventor lived in the U.S. during the 1930s, where for a short time he was the toast of the town, but he quickly fell into debt. After he returned to the Soviet Union in 1938, he was arrested and spent time in a labor camp before he was freedAonly to be forced to remain in service to the state. Glinsky, a composer and professor at Mercy Hurst College in Pennsylvania, is unable to resist the temptation to use Theremin as a metaphor for the political clash between communism and capitalism. Not only does this allegory lack nuanceAGlinsky himself notes that U.S. leftists were persecuted, albeit on a much lesser scale, during the McCarthy eraAbut the political focus clouds the author's portrait of Theremin's personality and prevents him from using his talents to evaluate Theremin's musical legacy.

Taran Matharu is a half-Brazilian, half-Indian author, born and raised in London.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Fletcher, 15, an orphan raised by a blacksmith in the Hominum Empire's northern village of Pelt discovers he has the ability to summon demonic creatures in this exciting fantasy trilogy opener. After Fletcher and Ignatius, his ferretlike demon, attack the local bully, Fletcher is forced to flee his village. Through a chance encounter with a mage, Fletcher finds himself attending an academy for battle mages. Trained mages are needed in Hominum's ongoing war with the orcs and in the armed truce against the elves. At the Academy, Fletcher, a commoner, endures scorn from the more skilled second-year students of noble birth, especially a pair of snobbish twin siblings, who are particularly cruel to Sylva, the elf chieftain's daughter, and the dwarf Othello. Dwarves are despised and treated as second-class citizens by many humans in Hominum. Their studies culminate in a year-end tournament that determines their student rankings and the opportunity for a senior military position. Fletcher and his small group of allies also become involved in a plot that threatens all of Hominum. This debut's similarities to J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" books, Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" (Knopf), and J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" (Scholastic) (the novel even has a nasty professor with a prejudice against commoners and other races) are unmistakable, but readers won't mind. Fletcher's a sympathetic character whose impulsive behavior leads him to make understandable mistakes. VERDICT The appealing characters, fast-paced plot, focus on racial politics, and interesting demon varieties (demonology addendum included) make this an enjoyable read.&#x2014;Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton</p><h2>Peanuts Every Sunday 1966-1970</h2><p>Since their original publication, Peanuts Sundays have almost always been collected and reprinted in black and white. But many who read Peanuts in their original Sunday papers remain fond of the striking coloring, which makes for a surprisingly different reading experience.The late 1960s strips in our latest volume depict Schulz at his philosophical and illustrative peak in one gorgeous, full-color coffee table book.</p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><h2>Persian Designs and Motifs for Artists and Craftsmen (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p><p>Over the centuries, Persia (Iran) has borne the brunt of periodic invasions.

When the going gets tough in this story, the tough crank up Kanye West, sing out loud and dance until they feel better. Check out Rowell's <i>Fangirl</i> playlist below to see what other music played a part in this story.</p> <p>"I Wonder" &#x2013; Kanye West: So Cath, the main character of Fangirl has a Kanye West thing; he's sort of her Patronus. This song lays out how lost Cath is at the beginning of the book. "You ever wonder what it all really mean? You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?"</p> <p>"Cath" &#x2013; Death Cab for Cutie: I think this song might be the reason I chose the name "Cath." The lyrics don't fit my Cath, but the feelings do. More loss, more lost.</p> <p>"Heaven's on Fire" &#x2013; The Radio Dept.: I use songs to help me get into the right mood and frame of mind when I'm writing a scene. This song, for me, is Cath's first few weeks of college &#x2013; when she feels all caught up, and completely overwhelmed, by the activity. When she's overdosing on new and other.</p> <p>"Paranoid" &#x2013; Kanye West feat. Mr. Hudson: When things hit bottom for Cath, she throws herself an Emergency Kanye Dance Party. I can see her jumping on her bed to this song. "You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things."</p> <p>"American Boy" &#x2013; Estelle feat. Kanye West: Required listening for every Emergency Kanye Dance Party. Plus, it's happy and bouncy, so that reminds me of Cath's friend Levi, who joins the party.</p> <p>"Brandy Alexander" &#x2013; Feist: When Cath finally falls in love, she almost resents how easy it is. She resents that she can't help it. This song is so sweet and seductive and irresistible &#x2013; which is exactly how Cath sees the guy she's falling for.</p> <p>"I See You, You See Me" &#x2013; The Magic Numbers: This is another reluctant love song &#x2013; about two people who sort of back into love. When it gets to "This is not what I'm like, this is not what I do" &#x2013; I think of Cath and the way she tries to reject her feelings. Like she's allergic to them.</p> <p>"Love Letters" &#x2013; Jude: There's a part of the book when just about everybody regrets their behavior. "Love Letters" feels like regret to me &#x2013; but also hope. There's so much longing in Jude's voice.</p> <p>"Samson" &#x2013; Regina Spektor: One of the love stories in the book is between Cath and her twin sister, Wren. Cath feels abandoned by Wren. Now that they're at college, Wren would rather party than hang out with her twin. But Cath is still so devoted to Wren, and worried about her. "You are my sweetest downfall. I loved you first."</p> <p>"Landslide" &#x2013; Fleetwood Mac: Every book I write has "Landslide" on its soundtrack, and always at the same point in the story &#x2013; the part where the main character does whatever he or she has to do to grow and change. I play "Landslide" in my head whenever my life is changing in a big way.</p> <p>"Hymn for Her" &#x2013; The Magic Numbers: This is my happy-ending song for Cath. I'm not exactly sure what the lyrics mean, but I love how gentle and cautious it is, especially at the beginning. It's so reassuring for a love song. "It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place. I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged."</p><strong>Best Books of the Month: Teen &amp; Young Adult, September 2013</strong>: At first glance Rainbow Rowell&#x2019;s <i>Fangirl </i> has a lot in common with <i>Eleanor &amp; Park</i>: idiosyncratic girl with troubled family meets good, normal boy and falls in love for the first time. But this is why Rowell is so talented--from the same basic ingredients she can create something new and special. In <i>Fangirl</i>, quirky introvert, Cath, is safe within the immensely popular <i>Simon Snow</i> (think <i>Harry Potter</i>) fan-fiction blog she writes with her twin sister, but college turns her life upside down, leaving her feeling like an awkward outsider. When she writes, Cath knows exactly what her characters should say to each other, but when it comes to forging real-life friendships, much less a romance, she hasn&#x2019;t a clue. An immensely satisfying coming-of-age novel, <i>Fangirl</i> deftly captures the experience of discovering your true voice and clumsy, vulnerable, remarkable, first love. <i>--Seira Wilson</i></p><h2>Baptism: A Vietnam Memoir</h2><p>"The 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry had the dubious distinction of being the unit that had fought the biggest battle of the war to date, and had suffered the worst casualties.

There, in the hotly contested Central Highlands, he served almost nine months as executive officer for Alpha Company, 2/7, fighting against crack NVA troops in some of the war's most horrific battles.<br><br>The bloodiest conflict of all began November 12, 1965, after 2nd Battalion was flown into the Ia Drang Valley west of Pleiku. Acting as point, Alpha Company spearheaded the battalion's march to landing zone Albany for pickup, not knowing they were walking into the killing zone of an NVA ambush that would cost them 10 percent casualties.<br><br>Gwin spares no one, including himself, in his gut-wrenching account of the agony of war. Through the stench of death and the acrid smell of napalm, he chronicles the Vietnam War in all its nightmarish horror.</p><p>Larry Gwin was commissioned as an infantry lieutenant out of Yale University in 1963. After two years with the 82nd Airborne Division, he served as an advisor to a South Vietnamese Army battalion in the Mekong Delta before joining the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in September 1965. Assigned to Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (A 2/7), he served as their executive officer for almost nine months. During that time, A 2/7 made more than forty-five combat assaults, fought in five major engagements, usually against North Vietnamese regulars, and suffered in excess of 70 percent casualties. Gwin returned from Vietnam as a captain and taught history as an ROTC instructor at Northeastern University before leaving the army and heading to Boston University Law School in 1968. Graduating in 1971, he practiced law in Boston until 1982, when he &#34;dropped out&#34; to write and teach. Since then he has written more than eighty-five published pieces, taught at the prep school and college levels, and commenced an arbitration practice. He has two grown sons, Sam and Rob, and resides north of Boston, where he continues to write and arbitrate securities cases. In 1996, he was awarded a Silver Star for his extraordinary heroism in the Ia Drang Valley. Baptism is his first book.Chapter 1<br> Getting There<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a soldier, he was marching to war, and the future looked bright.<br> &#x2014;BERNARD CORNWELL, Sharpe's Honor<br> &nbsp;<br> Those of us who went had our reasons. As Jack Fuller wrote in Fragments, &#x201c;It wasn't duty or honor or country or any lofty imperative. It had nothing to do with courage, moral or otherwise. It was simply who you were.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, almost. I went because my father had gone, and his father before him, and before that, my great-grandfather, who'd fought for the Confederacy. Had my dad been 4-F, or sold beef jerky to the War Department instead of volunteering for the army air corps in 1942, I might have felt otherwise. Who knows? What I'm trying to say is that I went because I thought it was the right thing to do, if I'd thought about it at all. About as much as the government had, I guess.<br> &nbsp;<br> I &#x201c;volunteered&#x201d; for Vietnam in the fall of '62. I was a senior at Yale, in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), and my understanding of the growing crisis in Southeast Asia had evolved from research for a political-science paper. I'd read that the U.S. military was advising the South Vietnamese and that the Communists were trying to wrest the country from its noble, dogged, democratic, pro-West leader, Ngo Dinh Diem. I'd heard my ROTC instructors expound on the domino theory. I'd leafed through Life magazine articles showing monkey-faced farmers in black pajamas and scar-faced blacks in the French Foreign Legion pitted against each other in a struggle over colonialism, too, but that was the ex- tent of my expertise. I had thought about Vietnam, but not in global terms. I was intrigued by its potential for challenge, the unaddressed question of how I 'd measure up in combat&#x2014; a question that would not have concerned me, I'm sure, if I hadn't been aware of my father's proud service in the &#x201c;Good War.&#x201d; We are, after all, who we are. So, I signed up.<br> &nbsp;<br> ROTC policy required seniors to request duty stations and schools. I went for the gusto: First choice&#x2014;10th Special Forces in Bad Tolz, Germany; second choice&#x2014;82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; third choice (overseas assignment required)&#x2014;Vietnam. Actually, I think the block said &#x201c;Southeast Asia.&#x201d; Schooling was easy: First choice&#x2014;Airborne School (jumping out of airplanes); second choice&#x2014;Ranger School (long-range patrolling, commando raids, etc.). It was all very simple then, standing in the green-walled ROTC office, aiming my number-two pencil at the printed government form and checking the right boxes. What fascinates me in retrospect is the seeming inevitability of my ending up in Vietnam. Some whisper in my ear, some member of my brain trust, some director in my psyche, guided me, inevitably, to the choices I made. They all seemed subliminal. From the time I checked the box for Ranger School (which embodied all the physical challenges a young man could want), I was jogging on an ineluctable treadmill into the maws of combat. Little did I know what lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Months later, when my orders came through, Bad Tolz was out. (I should have known.) Fort Bragg was in. The schooling came through as requested. I was on my way.<br> &nbsp;<br> That I had a penchant, if not a morbid fascination, for things military is clear. The first recollection I have was the day my father came home from the war&#x2014;Alaska, actually, where he'd spent two years manning airstrips on Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands. I vaguely remember a parade in Washington on VJ Day, cars driving around honking their horns, people dancing in the streets, acting crazily, flags flying everywhere. Then there were the little lead toy soldiers that I 'd arrange and rearrange in varied and sundry formations for endless hours in my room (and later, when I was older, outside, where I 'd plink at them with my BB gun). Then there was &#x201c;Victory at Sea&#x201d; (which the family watched religiously on Saturday nights seated in front of our first television set), and the inevitable war games of youth, where friends and I, decked out in army surplus, would dash around the neighborhood, defending our shores against an unseen but clearly imagined enemy, reliving those poignant moments we couldn't possibly appreciate but had seen in black and white on our TV sets. Later, in college, I ended up as the battalion commander of our army ROTC detachment, a dubious distinction, at best, in times of peace. At any rate, let's say I had a calling, if not an obsession; prospects, if not talent.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was reasonably intelligent, too&#x2014;what you might call an A student, generally at the top of my class (until college, where I discovered that there were other things to do than studying&#x2014; like boozing, sports, and wenching, albeit a relatively innocent form of it). My Yale roommates and I followed the simple dictum: &#x201c;Never let your work interfere with your education.&#x201d; I played football, hockey, and lacrosse, too. All this biographical detail is in the way of introduction, not self-adulation. Perhaps I was destined to serve my country&#x2014;certainly encouraged by John F. Kennedy's charismatic leadership. Signing up was just another step on the road. After all, we are who we are.<br> &nbsp;<br> And all the Gwin men had gone. My great-great-grandfather, James Gwin, had joined Davy Crockett and his cronies as they traipsed through Tennessee on their way to fight Mexicans in Texas. James died at the Alamo, leaving a widow and two sons back on their hardscrabble farm. One of those sons, Sylvester, grew up to serve the Confederacy. He lost half of his jaw fighting for John Bell Hood at Franklin, but survived. His manservant, a full-blooded Choctaw, dragged him from the battlefield and cleaned his wound with maggots, and Sylvester went on to farm cotton and raise four sons. One of them, my grandfather Sam, signed on with the Mississippi Volunteers when the Spanish American War broke out. Though he never got close to the action, he bore the moniker &#x201c;Cap'n&#x201d; 'til he died. He raised my dad, whom I've mentioned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Graduating from Yale in June of 1963, I commenced my apprenticeship with the 82d Airborne Division, the All American Division, and received the requisite training&#x2014; three weeks of Jump School in August, ten weeks of the Infantry Officers' Basic Course at Fort Benning, and nine weeks of Ranger School, which I completed just before Christmas. Ranger School was the icing on the cake and gave me confidence in my credentials, confidence that I was as good as any of the best of the West Point graduates.<br> &nbsp;<br> I took my job seriously, too. My generation had been raised under the shadow of the atomic bomb. During my junior year in college, I had watched the coverage of the Cuban missile crisis with more than thinly disguised interest and had applauded JFK's steadfast leadership. We, the United States of America, stood as the bastion of freedom, the watchdog of a tenuous peace. Arrayed against us at the time were the forces of evil, personified by the Soviet Union and the untold millions of the Red Horde, Red China, whose leaders had vowed openly to bury us. As an individual member of STRAC, the Strategic Army Corps, I was prepared to jump into the jaws of doom at a moment's notice. During almost every hour of my two years in the 82d Airborne Division, my instincts were honed for that seemingly inevitable eventuality. I served as a platoon leader in a rifle company, a battalion adjutant, and the commander of a raider platoon. I made more than forty jumps from a variety of aircraft, went on war games throughout the southern states and the Mo-jave Desert, and became increasingly aware of our growing military commitment in Vietnam. Many of my immediate superiors, whom I considered to be the finest officers in the army, were assigned there, and when I got my orders to proceed with several other first lieutenants to the MATA course (the Military Assistance and Training Advisory course), then to MACV (Military Advisory Command Vietnam) in Saigon, I was, believe it or not, quite thrilled. Saying farewell to friends in the 82d, we &#x201c;chosen few&#x201d; lieutenants signed out, drove four blocks up the street to Smoke Bomb Hill (where the Special Forces trained), and signed in to our six-week indoctrination in guerrilla warfare.<br> &nbsp;<br> MATA was the prerequisite program for service in MACV. The course consisted of morning lectures on counterinsurgency and afternoon lessons in the Vietnamese language. We had only one night exercise and a single parachute drop (to keep our Airborne status in case we opted to continue the tradition in Vietnam). After STRAC service, however, the MATA course seemed easy. Fun and games. What I was looking forward to was a two-month stint in Monterey, California, studying Vietnamese at the DLIWC&#x2014;the Defense Language Institute, West Coast. Afterward, the treadmill would take us west, across the Pacific, to the jungle, and from there, who knew? I didn't think too much about it, though. MATA was too much fun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Monterey was even more so, as our sole mission was to study Vietnamese at night and to speak it during the day. Too bad we never learned it. The rest of the time, we were busy cramming a life into the two months we had left in the good ole US of A. What else to do but fall in love? In my case it was the real thing (or so I believed with the absolute certainty of a twenty-three-year-old). Her name was Nicole, and she came from Montreal. When I departed for Vietnam, I was sure we would get married as soon as I came home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Between trips to San Francisco, dinners on Fisherman's Wharf, walks through Cannery Row, camping at Lake Tahoe, and an unforgettable hike up Big Sur (eight miles on a steep trail with a sixty-pound rucksack), all with Nicki in tow, I studied hard at Monterey. I had two best buddies there, too: Gene Cargile, a six-foot-five-inch Georgia boy who had captained the West Point basketball team, and Burt McCord, a square-jawed tanker with a beautiful wife and two children (a son aged one and a daughter in utero). Burt and his wife Eddie had rented an apartment in the early '60s equivalent of a condominium complex on the Carmel coast. After Vietnamese classes, Gene, Burt, and I would adjourn there, run a few miles along the coast and back, savoring the sea air and the beautiful vistas and preparing our bodies for the rigors of our coming tour. After the run, we'd retire to the sauna and study Vietnamese. Burt would do push-ups, dozens and dozens of them, with his feet on the bench, while I sat there sweating in the hot, stifling air, barely able to breathe. Prepared for the next day's recitations, Gene and I would meet our girlfriends in Monterey, leaving Burt and Eddie with their son.<br> &nbsp;<br> This idyllic two-month tour came to an end in July of '65.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Quilting Row by Row: 27 Skill-Building Techniques</h2><p>Sew pinwheel blocks, flying geese, and Dresden plates like a pro with a cheery, 11-row sampler quilt and 2 bonus projects.

L&#x2019;Enfant approached this task with unparalleled vigor and passion; however, his imperious and unyielding nature also made him many powerful enemies. After eleven months, Washington reluctantly dismissed L&#x2019;Enfant from the project. Subsequently, the plan for the city was published under another name, and L&#x2019;Enfant died long before it was rightfully attributed to him. Filled with incredible characters and passionate human drama, Scott W. Berg&#x2019;s deft narrative account of this little-explored story in American history is a tribute to the genius of Pierre Charles L'Enfant and the enduring city that is his legacy.</p><p>Scott W. Berg holds a BA in Architecture from the University of Minnesota, an MA from Miami University and an MFA in Creative Writing from George Mason University where he is now teaching non-fiction writing and literature. Since 1998, Berg has published over 60 pieces in the <i>Washington Post </i>on various subjects, many of them historical, including a lengthy feature story about L'Enfant out of which GRAND AVENUES grew.<b>Chapter 1: A Pedestal Waiting for a Superstructure</b><br><br>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1791<br><br>Major L'Enfant entered Georgetown well after dark, nearing the end of one exhausting journey and anxious to begin another. He arrived on foot, blanketed by a steady rain, his breath visible and his overcoat wet, his boots caked with mud, and his belongings packed onto his horse. The stagecoach that had been L'Enfant's southward conveyance had broken down many miles back, but the architect had not waited for another, eager to get to the banks of the Potomac River and begin what promised to be the culminating work of a lifetime.<br><br>The major was alone. He was unmarried, without family in the United States, and if there had been any romantic ties in New York City, where he'd lived for most of the past five years, they had been cut. His father, once an accomplished painter of battle scenes for the court of Louis XV, had died three years earlier. His mother was at home in Paris leading a widow's life in her apartment at the royal tapestry manufacture, sheltered by the king's soldiers from the strikes, protests, and bread riots proliferating elsewhere in the city. The French Revolution was gaining steam, but L'Enfant was not dwelling on the troubles in his homeland. He had already helped to bring about one revolution in America, and that was where his sights and thoughts remained.<br><br>The name and talents of Peter Charles L'Enfant were well known to many of America's most influential citizens, and his Federal Hall in New York was the most famous building in the nation. Now he had embarked upon a task that he knew would eventually require the labor of many thousands of men and the outlay of vast sums of money, a task that would also require that he maintain the approbation of the young nation's most eminent leader. Still the major thought of himself as the man who would single-handedly bring forth an entire city through the force of his own will. For other men it would have been a waking dream, but L'Enfant saw it as his destiny and his due.<br><br>He carried a letter dated the first of March from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson's instructions, approved by the president, gave L'Enfant the task of surveying the area along the Potomac River between Rock Creek, bordering Georgetown, and the mouth of the Eastern Branch, more than three miles to the southeast, in order that some section of that ground might be transformed into the new and permanent seat of government for the United States. The project was not just ambitious, it was unprecedented: the capital of a new world empire was to be set down in a quiet, sparsely inhabited territory of hills, forests, farms, and wetlands.<br><br>This city would not take shape through the slow accretion of time. It would not <i>happen</i>; it would be <i>made</i>. If it were to succeed, L'Enfant believed, it had to be planned by only one man. Though Jefferson's letter did not ask him to create a plan for the capital, L'Enfant had every expectation that his would be the hand holding the pencil, his the mind shaping the streets, squares, and monumental spaces, and his the name most closely associated with its realization. It was a deed in need of a fertile and tireless imagination, and he knew of only two individuals who possessed the necessary breadth of vision and reservoirs of commitment for its accomplishment: himself and the president. He had never failed George Washington in fifteen years of service to the American cause, and he would not do so now.<br><br>The spring was shaping up to be dour and difficult, and as L'Enfant moved downslope in the direction of the Potomac, past modest, well-kept structures of wood and brick, the streets were quieter than usual thanks to the chill and rain. The long journey surely would have awakened the old twinges in his leg. He had taken the wound eleven years earlier during the siege of Savannah, when, as a Continental Army captain desperate for distinction, he had rushed forward with a squad of men in a doomed attempt to set fire to a British infantry barrier. A musket volley at close range had ended his brief career in battle, and the resulting injury would eventually, in his old age, require the use of a cane. The wound would also become a badge of honor, an irrefutable soldierly credential he would invoke again and again when he felt his adopted country had turned its back on him.<br><br>Accustomed to the patient rhythms of agriculture and dominated by the wealth of a very few intertwined families, Georgetown in 1791 was a prosperous port town finishing the fourth decade of a growth spurt fueled by the proceeds of tobacco exportation. Situated on a sedate stretch of water just below the Potomac's final set of falls, peopled by roughly twenty-five hundred whites and five hundred African slaves, the town was a convivial stopover for travelers taking overland trips along the eastern seaboard. Provincial and unassuming as it could seem, Georgetown was also familiar with the dialects of all fourteen states and the accents of many countries; its leading ladies dressed in European fashions, and its harbor was often host to foreign ships.<br><br>L'Enfant passed homes, attorneys' offices, and dry goods emporiums, watchmakers and barbershops and furniture stores, until he reached his destination just a few storefronts from the lapping waters of the Potomac. The Fountain Inn was a simple two-story wooden tavern and hotel with a stable on the premises. The entire operation was better known as Suter's, thanks to the popularity of its proprietor, John Suter, friend and host to politicians, businessmen, ambassadors, and other varieties of wandering gentlemen. L'Enfant was a distinguished arrival, sent to Georgetown by the president himself, but he made little time for conversation. Rather than settle into his rooms for the evening, he asked for directions and went back out into the damp toward the home of Mayor Thomas Beall. According to Jefferson's instructions, that was where L'Enfant was to make arrangements for the assistants and materials necessary for his surveying work.<br><br>L'Enfant was thirty-six years old in March 1791 and, aside from any lingering ache in his leg, in good physical health. It is one of the many blunt ironies of the major's life story that no authenticated image of him exists, outside of a single small silhouette made around 1785. Contemporary observers never quite agreed on a physical description, supplying only a vague outline of a man on the tall side with a prominent nose who, at least in the period before his work on the capital, usually presented an elegant appearance and carried himself as a gentleman. But those who crossed professional paths with L'Enfant were unanimous in describing him as a passionate talker, an unquenchable egoist who was monomaniacal about his work and convinced that he was the only person who could do that work so well. He certainly wasn't the kind of man to wonder if others might prefer that he wait until morning to begin.<br><br>Mayor Beall might have been taken aback by the late hour, but he had no reason to be anything but affable and offered the major a greeting and an apology, for it turned out that he knew nothing of the architect's needs and had no help at hand. L'Enfant was quickly able to establish his bona fides and receive the necessary assurances, but the mix-up was vexing. How had Jefferson, Washington's second on matters regarding the federal city, failed to prepare the mayor of Georgetown for this moment? L'Enfant knew that the surveyor Andrew Ellicott had also taken a room at Suter's and was already four weeks into the arduous work of setting off the ten-by-ten-mile square, tilted on its point, that was to contain the new seat of government. Had Ellicott's arrival met with a similarly unaccountable lack of advance notice? Workers had to be hired and paid, tools procured; there were myriad moving parts to put in motion.<br><br>An artist in possession of the most advanced professional training available in Europe, L'Enfant had left Paris at the age of twenty-two, arriving in America early in 1777 as a temporarily commissioned lieutenant in the Continental Army. Over the next six years he'd risen to the rank of captain and finally to major as he experienced firsthand the physical deprivation, precarious progress, and principled sacrifice of the War for Independence. The list of men he'd befriended and impressed along the way included many of the most famous soldiers and politicians of his time. Still, all that adventure was only a prelude: this inchoate seat of federal government along the Potomac was now of paramount importance, and here the greatest of L'Enfant's ambitions would be fulfilled.<br><br>The next day he rose to an unfortunate sight: the rain through which he'd slogged the night before had not lessened in vigor. The survey he was to perform for Washington and Jefferson required visibility, the ability to find high ground and grasp the rise and fall of hundreds and even thousands of acres of land. Given the conditions, he might have been forgiven for staying inside to rest and catch up on some long-overdue correspondence. But he had waited years for this opportunity and was past ready to begin. Without bothering to wait on the supplies and assistants that Mayor Beall was hastily arranging, L'Enfant donned his hat and coat, retrieved his horse, and rode off into the rain.<br>The largest stone in the political foundation of L'Enfant's journey had been laid eight months earlier, in July 1790, with the passage of the Residence Act. These six paragraphs of federal legislation authorized President Washington to place a district of one hundred square miles somewhere along the Potomac between the Eastern Branch and the Conococheague Creek, eighty miles upriver, for the establishment of a national capital. No state would have jurisdiction in this territory following the transfer of the federal government from Philadelphia, a move set for December 1800. It was a deadline so close&#x2014;less than ten years away&#x2014;as to seem fanciful, even laughable, to many Americans.<br><br>The establishment of the federal city spoke of the preeminence of George Washington, who'd been given control over nearly every aspect of its creation, from the choice of its location to the appointment of surveyors and commissioners. But it spoke just as loudly of angry divisions between North and South, both of which had schemed and argued since the end of the War for Independence to claim the national capital. Not only was the presumed political, economic, and social bounty of the seat of government at stake; so too was something more ineffable: the chance to become the locus of the world's next great empire. Washington's proclamation placing the district just upriver from his home at Mount Vernon, at nearly the precise halfway point between northernmost Maine and southernmost Georgia, had finally quieted nearly a decade of backroom deal making, congressional oration, and fiery newspaper editorializing over more than thirty potential locations, including undeveloped sites along the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers as well as the existing locales of New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. From this point forward, the arguments would circle around what the city should be, not where to put it or whether it should be built at all.<br><br>For the residents of the region where the Potomac and the Eastern Branch met, the choice of ground was not a matter of ideological symbolism or sectional disputes. It was, rather, a matter of sizable personal gain. L'Enfant's arrival was important to the propertied men of Georgetown and other landholders within the limits of the new federal district, who were ready to watch his every move&#x2014;what he viewed and measured&#x2014;because these movements would presumably offer their best clues to the president's intentions. It was something of a lottery: once Washington pointed to a surveyor's map of the district and said the capital would rise <i>here</i>, the landowners in and around that spot might find their financial dreams come true. As L'Enfant headed out of Georgetown on the morning of March 10, there were eyes on his back and talk behind it.<br>In a set of notes on the implementation of the Residence Act written for Washington in November 1790, Thomas Jefferson had proposed making a direct appeal to avarice:<br><br>"When the President shall have made up his mind as to the spot for the town, would there be any impropriety in his saying to the neighboring landowners, "I will fix the town here if you will join and purchase and give the lands." They may well afford it from the increase of value it will give to their own circumjacent lands."<br><br>Washington agreed and wanted any announcements or visible preparations to strongly suggest that the city's exact location was open to negotiation should one group of landholders be willing to offer more advantageous terms than another.<br><br>The president and the secretary of state had reasons to prefer either one of two sites: the ground just across Rock Creek from Georgetown or the unrealized "paper town" of Carrollsburg on the prong of land where the Potomac met the Eastern Branch, 160 acres laid out on speculation into 268 building lots but still absent of streets and new structures. The Rock Creek choice meant immediate proximity to a preexisting social and commercial infrastructure, while the other boasted excellent undeveloped terrain and shoreline on two navigable rivers. Though today these spots both rest comfortably within the capital, in 1791 Washington and Jefferson viewed them as entirely separate contenders for the location of the seat of government. They knew that the asking price of lots circling the area they designated for the Capitol and the President's House would climb steeply the moment their decision was made public, and so they were looking to obtain as much land as possible before such an announcement was made.<br><br>Washington had begun this quest by supplying William Deakins and Peter Stoddert, two of the district's property owners, with survey maps and telling them to acquire as much land as possible in their own names. Provided these were clean buys, free of legal baggage or disputed boundary lines, the lots would be transferred to the federal government and paid for "so as to excite no suspicion that they are on behalf of the public." Even a few hundred acres in hand as L'Enfant began his work would give the government some leverage going into what threatened to become bare-knuckle negotiations. It needed that leverage soon: Deakins, Stoddert, Jefferson, and Washington were all racing against the creation of eminent domain laws in Maryland that would require the payment of more than fifty dollars per acre, a price the president thought well out of the reach of the federal treasury.<br><br>These undercover preparations help to explain why L'Enfant was told to begin his work on the Eastern Branch. In theory, his presence along that river with surveyor's tools in tow would create the impression that the president was about to make his choice. Should the ruse succeed, went the logic, those with property near Georgetown&#x2014;a much larger and more vocal group of men than the wealthy few with an interest in and around Carrollsburg&#x2014;would sell more quickly and cheaply rather than watch the center of American government, and the profit, head to their neighbors' ground.</p><h2>The Extracellular Matrix and Ground Regulation: Basis for a Holistic Biological Medicine</h2><p>The workings of the suitable environment for cells&#x2014;called the extracellular matrix (ECM) and ground regulation&#x2014;has occupied the European medical tradition since the early part of the 20th century. As it has become more clear that the origin of disease and its first signals register in the connective tissue, or myofascia, cellular pathologists and biochemists have sought to circumscribe networks of cell communication and microcirculation in the ECM. <br><br> Alfred Pischinger (1899-1982) continued this line of work by further studying, in work published from 1926 through the late seventies, the connections of the ECM to the hormonal and autonomic systems. In the last twenty years Professor and Doctor of Natural Sciences Hartmut Heine and his colleagues have carried on Pischinger&#x2019;s work, here summarized in one volume. Part One encompasses theoretical underpinnings; Parts Two and Three address applications and directions for further research.<br><br> This updated English-language translation not only is an account of the work of Pischinger&#x2019;s successors&#x2014;Heine, Otto Bergsmann, and Felix Perger, (the three editors of this volume) and their many colleagues&#x2014;but notes the positive development of complementary therapies based on this understanding of histology. Acupuncture is referenced directly. Both in Europe and the States the work of manual therapists, including Rolfers, cranio- sacral therapists, and other somatic disciplines have been informed for many years by Pischinger&#x2019;s outsider model of how changes in the EMC register in the central nervous system and the brain, and are conveyed back to the periphery and connected organs. Heine&#x2019;s exciting recent work shows that the regulation and construction of the ECM have relationships to cybernetic non-linear systems and phase transitions.</p><p>Author Alfred Pischinger was the first scientist to develop a theory for complementary (holistic) medicine based on the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ground regulation).

This refutes the prevalent understanding of connective tissue as inert filler, or packing material. With Pischinger&#x2019;s work we&#x2019;re transported to a whole world of function taking place on a cellular level. To better understand many of the operations that manual therapy interacts with, we&#x2019;d be hard-pressed to find a more relevant and significant resource.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Frank Lowen, founder of BioValent Manual Therapy, Albuquerque, NM<br><br>&#x201c;Pischinger&#x2019;s classic book gives alternative health-care practitioners the scientific evidence and detailed physical structure of the basic principle of their disciplines. In chiropractic this principle is called the &#x2018;innate intelligence&#x2019; of the body to heal itself; in naturopathy, homeopathy, and other natural healing arts, it is called the &#x2018;terrain&#x2019; of the body, and is considered crucial to health. Manual therapists (physical therapists, massage therapists, and others) will gain new insight into how touch affects fascia and other connective tissue. There is a large section on how acupuncture regulates the extracellular matrix, and the mind-body connection is explored. <br><br>&#x201c;This new revised translation deepens the health-care professional&#x2019;s understanding of both the complexity of fascial relationships and the simplicity of the healing process.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ingeborg Eibl, translator, DC, ND, Rochester, NY</p><h2>The Ugly Renaissance: Sex, Greed, Violence and Depravity in an Age of Beauty</h2><p><p><i>The Ugly Renaissance </i>is a delightfully debauched tour of the sordid, gritty reality behind some of the most celebrated artworks and cultural innovations of all time.<br><br>Tourists today flock to Italy by the millions to admire the stunning achievements of the Renaissance&#x2014;paintings, statues, and buildings that are the legacy of one of the greatest periods of cultural rebirth and artistic beauty the world has ever seen. But beneath the elegant surface lurked a seamy, vicious world of power politics, perversity, and corruption. In this meticulously researched and lively portrait, Renaissance scholar Alexander Lee illuminates the dark and titillating contradictions that existed alongside the enlightened spirit of the time: the scheming bankers, greedy politicians, bloody rivalries, murderous artists, religious conflicts, rampant disease, and indulgent excess without which many of the most beautiful monuments of the Renaissance would never have come into being.</p></p><p>ALEXANDER LEE is a fellow in the Centre for the Study of the Renaissance at the University of Warwick. A prize-winning specialist in the history of the Italian Renaissance, he holds degrees from the universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and has held posts at Oxford, Luxembourg, and Bergamo. He is the author of numerous academic works on the Renaissance, including, most recently, <i>Petrarch and St. Augustine: Classical Scholarship, Christian Theology and the Origins of the Renaissance of Italy</i>, and is currently working on a new biography of Niccol� Machiavelli.<p><b>1&nbsp; Michelangelo's Nose</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One fine&nbsp;summer&#x2019;s afternoon in 1491, the sixteen-year-old Michelangelo Buonarroti was sitting sketching in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. With a stick of chalk between his fingers and a sheaf of paper on his knees, he was busy copying Masaccio&#x2019;s celebrated frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel with &#x201c;such judgement&#x201d; that all those who saw his drawings were astonished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as an adolescent, Michelangelo had begun to grow used to such admiration. Despite his youth, he had already earned a degree of celebrity and had acquired a correspondingly high opinion of himself. Carrying a letter of recommendation from the artist Domenico Ghirlandaio, he had not only been accepted as a pupil of the sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni at the artistic school that had recently been founded in the gardens of San Marco, but had even been welcomed into the household of Lorenzo de&#x2019; Medici, Florence&#x2019;s de facto ruler. Enraptured by the young man, Lorenzo had ushered Michelangelo into the company of the city&#x2019;s foremost intellectuals, including the humanists Angelo Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola. Michelangelo flourished. He nurtured those skills that were to characterize the art of the period. Studying anatomy with extreme care, he honed the naturalistic style that had been in continuous development since the innovations of Giotto di Bondone, two centuries earlier. And devoting himself to the emulation of classical sculpture, he set out on the path that later led Giorgio Vasari to claim that he had &#x201c;surpassed and vanquished the ancients.&#x201d; Following a suggestion made by Poliziano in this period, he carved a relief depicting the battle of the centaurs that was &#x201c;so beautiful&#x201d; it seemed to be &#x201c;the work not of a young man, but of a great master with a wealth of study and experience behind him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelangelo&#x2019;s fame and self-confidence were growing by the day, but as he was about to discover, so was the envy of his schoolfellows. Sitting next to him in the Brancacci Chapel that day was Pietro Torrigiano. Although three years older than Michelangelo, Pietro was another of Bertoldo di Giovanni&#x2019;s pupils and was also recognized as something of a rising star. Competition between the two was almost inevitable. Under Bertoldo&#x2019;s tutelage, they had been encouraged to compete, and they strove to outdo each other in imitating and surpassing the works of masters like Masaccio. Michelangelo was, however, too brilliant and outspoken for the rivalry to be entirely friendly.<br>As they sketched alongside one another in the chapel, Michelangelo and Pietro appear to have begun discussing who was better placed to take up Masaccio&#x2019;s mantle as Florence&#x2019;s finest painter. Given their sur- roundings, it was a natural subject. Despite being acclaimed as an artist of genius in his own lifetime, Masaccio had died before he could com- plete the frescoes in the chapel. His work had been completed by Filippino Lippi, although how successfully was a matter of personal opinion. Perhaps Michelangelo, who had spent many months studying the frescoes, observed that Lippi had been unable to match Masaccio&#x2019;s talent and that he himself was the only person capable of attaining&#x2014;if not exceeding&#x2014;the master&#x2019;s standards. He may simply have spoken derisively of Pietro&#x2019;s sketches, as was apparently his habit. Whatever the case, Michelangelo managed to enrage his friend. Talented but hardly brilliant, Pietro couldn&#x2019;t stand Michelangelo&#x2019;s ribbing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jealous &nbsp;[at] seeing him more &nbsp;honoured &nbsp;than himself and more able in his work,&#x201d; Pietro began mocking Michelangelo. &nbsp;If his behavior in later years is anything to go by, Michelangelo might simply have laughed. Whatever the case, Pietro was furious. Clenching his fists, he punched Michelangelo squarely in the face. The blow was so hard that it &#x201c;almost tore off the cartilage of [the] nose.&#x201d; Michelangelo slumped unconscious to the floor, his nose &#x201c;broken and crushed&#x201d; and his torso covered with blood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelangelo was hurriedly carried back to his home in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, where he is said to have been lying &#x201c;as if dead.&#x201d; It did not take Lorenzo de&#x2019; Medici long to learn of his plight. Storming into the room in which his stricken prot�g� lay, he flew into a towering rage and hurled every imaginable insult at the &#x201c;bestial&#x201d; Pietro. At once, Pietro saw the magnitude of his mistake: he had no option but to leave Florence.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*<br>&nbsp;<br>Unwittingly, the barely conscious Michelangelo was caught up in a moment that captured perfectly an important dimension of the world of late Renaissance art and that represented the fulfillment of what has become known as the &#x201c;rise of the artist.&#x201d; Although he was only sixteen years old, he had already begun to hone that unique combination of talents that contemporaries would later describe as &#x201c;divine.&#x201d; Skilled in sculpture and drawing, he was also devoted to Dante, learned in the Italian classics, a fine poet, and a friend to the finest humanist minds. Without any sense of irony intended, he was what we might now call a Renaissance man. What&#x2019;s more, he was recognized as such. Despite his age, Michelangelo had been feted by Florence&#x2019;s social and intellectual elite, and his ability had been honored with patronage and respect. The son of a comparatively modest bureaucrat from an obscure little town, he had earned the affection of the most powerful family in Florence because of his artistic skill. Lorenzo &#x201c;the Magnificent&#x201d;&#x2014;himself a noted poet, connoisseur, and collector&#x2014;treated him &#x201c;like a son.&#x201d; Indeed, Lorenzo&#x2019;s &nbsp;son Giovanni and Giovanni&#x2019;s &nbsp;illegitimate cousin Giulio&#x2014;each of whom would later become pope (as Leo X and Clem- ent VII, respectively) &#x2014;would address him as their &#x201c;brother&#x201d; ever after.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred years earlier, it would have been unthinkable for any artist to have been honored in such a way. In the eyes of most contemporaries, a late-thirteenth- or early-fourteenth-century artist was not a creator but a craftsman. The practitioner of a merely mechanical art, he was largely restricted to the confines of a provincial <i>bottega </i>(workshop) that was subject to the often draconian regulations of guilds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of &nbsp;his ability, the&nbsp; artist&#x2019;s &nbsp;social status was not &nbsp;high. Although some early Renaissance artists occasionally occupied positions in communal government or came from magnate families, they were the exceptions rather than the rule. Most came from fairly humble backgrounds, as can be gauged from how little we know about their parents. Later biographers, like the snobbish Vasari, often &nbsp;skip over such details, and their silence suggests that carpenters, innkeepers, farmers, and even unskilled laborers may have sired some of the great names of early Renaissance art. What evidence we have seems to confirm this impression. Some artists were from very modest backgrounds and came from families engaged in the lowliest crafts. Giotto di Bondone, for example, was rumored to have been raised as a poor shepherd boy but was most probably the son of a Florentine blacksmith. For others, art&#x2014;like carpentry&#x2014;was a family business. Three of Duccio di Buoninsegna&#x2019;s sons became painters, and Simone Martini&#x2019;s brother and two brothers-in-law were all artists.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mid-fourteenth century onward, however, the social world of art and the artist had gradually undergone a series of radical changes. In step with the growing popularity of classical themes and the naturalistic style, artists were progressively recognized as autonomous creative agents endowed with learning and skill that set them apart from mere mechanics. When Giotto was made <i>capomaestro </i>of the Duomo in 1334, the priors of Florence acknowledged not only his fame but also his &#x201c;knowledge and learning,&#x201d; terms that clearly distinguished the artist from mere craftsmen. Similarly, writing in his <i>De origine civitatis Florentiae et eiusdem famosis civibus </i>(ca. 1380&#x2013;81), the Florentine chronicler Filippo Villani felt able to compare painters not with mere mechanics but with the masters of the liberal arts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still reliant on the favor of patrons and bound by contractual agreements, painters and sculptors had seen their social position improve dramatically by the mid-fifteenth century. With art coming to be seen as a status symbol, artists themselves attained a higher status. Now it was not merely those from families of craftsmen who became artists. Although some continued to come from humble stock&#x2014;such as Andrea Mantegna (1431&#x2013;1506)&#x2014;artists were increasingly the sons (and, in very rare cases, the daughters) of skilled tradesmen, affluent merchants, and well-educated notaries. Even those who could lay claim to noble origins&#x2014;such as Michelangelo&#x2014;could take up the brush or chisel without undue shame. Their social standing was measured not against their birth but against their ability. They could treat with their patrons on the basis of mutual respect, if not always with perfect equality. And their achievements could be celebrated by historians like Vasari in a manner previously reserved only for statesmen. Indeed, so high had artists risen that Pope Paul III is reported to have remarked that artists like Benvenuto Cellini (1500&#x2013;71) should &#x201c;not be subjected to the law.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if &nbsp;Michelangelo embodied both the stylistic transformations and the social changes that had come to characterize the art of the period, he also exemplified another important dimension of the life of the Renaissance artist. Though the &#x201c;rise of the artist&#x201d; had improved both the esteem in which the visual arts were held and the social status of artists, it had not elevated artists themselves to a higher and more refined plane of existence. Artists like Michelangelo still had feet of clay. He had, after all, just had his nose broken in a childish brawl prompted by envy and exacerbated by arrogant boasting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was typical of his life. Entirely at home in the reception rooms of the mighty, he could be kind, sensitive, courteous, and funny. But he was also proud, touchy, scornful, and sharp-tongued. He was a frequenter of inns and no stranger to fights. Indeed, despite being a friend to popes and princes, he was no refined gentleman. As his biographer Paolo Giovio recorded, he was notoriously slovenly in his appearance and seemed almost to rejoice in living in the most squalid conditions. Scarcely ever changing his clothes, he was constantly accompanied by the noxious smell of the unwashed and seldom, if ever, combed his hair or cut his beard. He was a man of undoubted piety, but his passionate nature inclined him toward relations with both sexes. Although he later enjoyed a long and apparently romantic relationship with Vittoria Colonna, marchesa of Pescara, his surviving poems also address homoerotic themes. One of the many poems addressed to Tommaso de&#x2019; Cavalieri, for example, begins with a striking and faintly blasphemous verse:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in your lovely face I see, my lord,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what in this life no words could ever tell;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with that, although still clothed in flesh, my soul&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has often already risen up to God.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As arrogant as he was talented, he was a dirty, disorganized, and tormented individual who was as easily embroiled in fights as he was bound to the will of popes, and as susceptible to Neoplatonic homoeroticism as he was to the reassurances of the Church and the blandish- ments of a cultured and elegant lady.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelangelo was not unusual in this respect. A devotee of illicit magic, Leonardo da Vinci was accused of sodomizing a well-known gigolo named Jacopo Saltarelli on April 9, 1476. Benvenuto Cellini was convicted of the same offense twice (in 1523 &nbsp;and 1557) and was only narrowly saved from a lengthy prison sentence thanks to the intervention of the Medici; on top of this, he killed at least two men and was also accused of stealing the papal jewels. So, too, Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch)&#x2014;often described as the father of Renaissance humanism&#x2014;fathered at least two children while in minor orders, and the music of the aristocratic composer Carlo Gesualdo reached its most sublime heights only after he had murdered his wife, her lover, and possibly also his son.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When its implications are unpacked, therefore, Michelangelo&#x2019;s broken nose appears to present something of a challenge. Superficially, it seems difficult to reconcile the idea of Michelangelo as the paradigmatically &#x201c;Renaissance&#x201d; artist with the image of Michelangelo the cocky and arrogant kid fighting in church. There is no doubt that these represent two sides of the same man, but the question is, how should the peculiar and apparently contradictory nature of Michelangelo&#x2019;s character be understood? How could the same personality create such innovative, elevated art and indulge such base habits? &nbsp;How, indeed, can Michelangelo&#x2019;s broken nose be reconciled with familiar conceptions of the Renaissance itself?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Justice League Odyssey 1: The Ghost Sector</h2><p><b>When a cosmic menace threatens worlds beyond our own in the Ghost Sector, it falls to a new Justice League team to answer the call to battle!

In this haunting account of the young Hemingways, Gioia Diliberto explores their passionate courtship, their family life in Paris with baby Bumby, and their thrilling, adventurous relationship&#x2014;a literary love story scarred by Hadley&#x2019;s loss of the only copy of Hemingway&#x2019;s first novel and ultimately destroyed by a devastating m�nage � trois on the French Riviera.</p><p>Compelling, illuminating, poignant, and deeply insightful, <em>Paris Without End</em> provides a rare, intimate glimpse of the writer who so fully captured the American imagination and the remarkable woman who inspired his passion and his art&#x2014;the only woman Hemingway never stopped loving.</p><p>Gioia Diliberto is a journalist, biographer, and novelist. She is the author of the biographies <em>Paris without End: The True Story of Hemingway's First Wife</em>, <em>A Useful Woman: The Early Life of Jane Addams</em>, and <em>Debutante: The Story of Brenda Frazier</em> and the novels <em>I Am Madame X </em>and <em>The Collection</em>.

Bateson's reflections bring theses narratives homes, proposing surprising new vision of our own diverse and changing society and offering us the courage to participate even as we are still learning.</p></p><p>Mary Catherine Bateson is Clarence J. Robinson Professor in Anthropology and English at George Mason University. She received an undergraduate degree from Radcliffe and a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She has written and coauthored numerous books on life history, lectures internationally, and is president of the Institute for Intercultural Studies in New York City. She divides her time between New Hampshire and Virginia.In her earlier works, Bateson has written about "two intellectual pioneers," her parents Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and in her surprise best-seller, <i>Composing a Life</i> (1989), the elusive phenomenon of creativity. Here she turns the beam of her ardent, disciplined mind on the crucial and often misunderstood process of learning. Bateson believes that our educational system has many shortcomings, most of which are traceable to some basic misconceptions about how we learn, a lifelong process essential to survival. To live well and responsibly in a diverse and dynamic world, Bateson explains, we must learn not only to accept, but to treasure a multiplicity of viewpoints, the persistence of ambiguity, and the constancy of change. We must learn to see the big picture, be attentive to subtleties, absorb "peripheral visions," and excel at improvisation. To illustrate these sensible and versatile theories, Bateson relates intriguing stories from her culturally diverse life, especially her experiences living in Israel, Iran, and the Philippines. She considers learning within the contexts of parent-child relationships, ritual, the power of metaphor, the mutability of the self, the obsession with novelty, and the pitfalls of fundamentalism and other instances of "narrowed attention." She also frees "multiculturalism" from its superficial and political trappings and altogether invigorates her readers with her faith in our adaptive abilities. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Given Sacrifice (A Novel of the Change)</h2><p>Rudi Mackenzie has won the battle that expelled the enemy from the new High Kingdom of Montival.&nbsp;Now he must free the people who live in the state once known as Idaho from occupation by the legions of the Church Universal and Triumphant and pursue them to their lair over the mountains.

Dive out!</i> training and reflex said.</p><p>She did. Her hands and feet moved on the controls of the glider with delicate precision, coaxing the last ounce of performance out of the Glaser&#x2013;Dirk 100. Air whistled by, the loudest thing in the profound silence of the sky; the cockpit was paradoxically stuffy and smelled of lubricants, ancient plastic and fresher leather and fear&#x2013;sweat. The falling&#x2013;sled sensation went away, but she&#x2019;d gone down three or four hundred crucial feet. Her head whipped around, and she saw uncomfortably high ground all around her, a situation that had gone from <i>chancy </i> to <i>bad </i> all at once. This was unfamiliar territory, known only from the map&#x2014;that was the whole point of reconnaissance flying, but it made things a lot more dangerous. Over the country she knew well the spots for likely lift were all as familiar as the feel of her bootlaces. Here, not so much.</p><p><i>Of course, I know where the nearest three landing points are. Only now I can&#x2019;t get to any of them.</i></p><p>She was over dense forest, with a saw&#x2013;toothed ridge of nearly vertical rock directly ahead; she could get to it, but not over it to the steep river&#x2013;valley beyond. Alyssa shoved the goggles up on the forehead of her leather helmet, hiding the snarling face&#x2013;on bear&#x2019;s head worked into the hide there. Her eyes peered at the air over the ridge.</p><p><i>Shit. No birds.</i></p><p>Birds were a good way to find air moving upward; lots of them didn&#x2019;t like to flap if they could avoid it. So probably no updraft directly ahead. She was sweating and her mouth was dry, but there was no <i>time</i> to be afraid. Her hand moved on the stick, very gently, no rudder, just the shallowest of banking turns to cruise along the face of the ridge looking for a spot where there <i>was</i> an updraft.</p><p><i>No joy.</i></p><p>The aircraft was losing one foot of altitude for every forty it went forward towards a sheer slope, and there weren&#x2019;t that many feet left before you ran into the trees and rocks below. She was moving faster than a galloping horse, faster than a pedalcar on rails, faster than virtually anything else in the world except a peregrine falcon stooping or a catapult bolt, and when hundreds of pounds hit at speed . . . the gentle floating of the glider would abruptly transition to nasty un&#x2013;Changed calculations of kinetic energy release and the strength factors of human bone and tissue. <i>Her</i> bone and tissue. The only good thing was that this wasn&#x2019;t happening over enemy&#x2013;held territory; it was pretty well uninhabited around here these days.</p><p><i>If I can get this thing down in one piece, we can bring in a horse team and pack it out.</i></p><p>They&#x2019;d been built to disassemble, and been modified since to do it more thoroughly.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, my beauty, let&#x2019;s <i>do</i> this,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>Some of her older instructors had been pilots before the Change, when powered aircraft could just bull their way through the air. Most of the time she agreed with the modern school which held that dancing with the invisible currents of the sky&#x2013;ocean was preferable, but right now something to just <i>push</i> would be welcome. And aesthetics be damned.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, shit, Bearkiller,&#x201d; she told herself as she leveled out again, sparing a quick glance downward.</p><p>&#x201c;OK, the Bear Lord was aloft in something a lot less aerodynamic and with a lot higher stall speed than this over mountains not all that far from here when the Change hit. With Dad and Aunt Signe and all in the backseats. Uncle Mike walked away . . . well, swam away . . . from a real hard landing, the rest of the family survived too; so will you if it comes to that.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Although he just barely survived. Holy Mary Mother of God, if he hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;</i></p><p>Since she&#x2019;d gotten her wings a little while ago she had a much better grasp of what a combination of blind luck and superlative piloting had been required at the very beginning of the Bearkiller legend. Her mind blanched at the thought that the whole world she knew including her personal self wouldn&#x2019;t have existed if her aunt&#x2019;s future husband been just a little less skillful or fortunate.</p><p><i>So I&#x2019;ve got to live. Maybe as much depends on me!</i></p><p>She turned away from the ridge to try and get closer to base. That ridge ahead was going to be <i>really</i> close, looking like a fanged jaw reaching for her. Her gut tightened in an involuntary effort to haul the sailplane upward by sheer willpower. She absolutely needed to climb at least a bit, but she <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i> put the nose any higher. If she tried she wouldn&#x2019;t climb, she&#x2019;d just drop below stalling speed and fall out of the sky like a leaf in autumn as the wings lost lift.</p><p><i>Like a leaf in autumn except for the last crunchy bit. Just a little more, then slam the stick down once I clear the crest to get some margin back, then go looking for an updraft&#x2014;</i></p><p>Speed was dropping. Dropping fast, <i>too</i> fast. Reflex tried to make her turn the nose down again, but that would mean diving into the mountain slope so bloody damned close below.</p><p><i>Just another hundred yards . . .</i></p><p>Stalling felt like slipping backward an instant after the controls went mushy.</p><p><i>Oh</i> <i>fuck me, what utter brass&#x2013;assed moron came up with this mission in the first place&#x2014;</i></p><p>The left wingtip brushed the top of a tall larch less than a second later. Whirling impact, battering, tossing, the scream of tearing metal. She shouted and flung her arms up in front of her face.</p><p>High King&#x2019;s Host, Boise Contingent HQ</p><p>County Palatine of the Eastermark</p><p>(formerly eastern Washington State)</p><p>High Kingdom of Montival</p><p>(formerly western North America)</p><p>June 1st, Change Year 26/2024 AD</p><p>Fred Thurston was dickering with a would&#x2013;be defector from what remained of the United States of Boise&#x2019;s army. Rudi Mackenzie stayed in the shadows at the back of the tent, arms crossed on his chest, ignored after a single startled glance and a jerk of Rudi&#x2019;s head towards Fred. The man who was now High King Artos of Montival kept silent; he was scrupulous in not interfering in the chain of command without very pressing need, and with Fred such was very rare indeed.</p><p><i>Though there&#x2019;s need more often than I&#x2019;d like with others.</i></p><p>Artos the First was a young man, a Changeling as it was called here&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been born near Yule of that year&#x2014;but the High Kingdom of Montival was far younger. Its armies were cobbled together from what had been a dozen separate realms, many of them with a history of mutual suspicion or outright battle. Everything was a makeshift of constant improvisation.</p><p><i>You fight with what you have, not what you&#x2019;d wish</i>, Rudi thought.</p><p>Even if you were fighting the biggest war since the Change. Certainly the biggest in North America since then, if you didn&#x2019;t count the desperate scrambles in the months after the machines stopped. Not the biggest in the world, probably; Asia still weighed heavily in the nine&#x2013;tenths&#x2013;reduced total of humankind. Rumors trickled in now and then across seas pirate&#x2013;haunted when they weren&#x2019;t empty. They spoke of warlords fighting each other and invaders from Mongolia and Tibet across the ruins of China, and the bloody rise of <i>Mahendr Shuddhikartaa hai</i>&#x2014;Mahendra the Purifier&#x2014;carving out a new empire called Hinduraj on the Bay of Bengal. . . .</p><p><i>The world is wider and wilder than we can know. But this is the part the Powers have set me to ward.</i></p><p>The defector and Fred had gotten down to cases more rapidly than Rudi would have considered tactful at first, which was another reason he was leaving this in his friend&#x2019;s capable hands. Someone who&#x2019;d grown up among Boise&#x2019;s folk would understand them in ways that Rudi never quite could, even bearing the Sword of the Lady. The officer wouldn&#x2019;t be his subject unless and until he came to an agreement with Fred, and even then only indirectly.</p><p>He and Fred had gone all the way to Nantucket and back together on the Quest; they were comrades and allies, but lord and sworn follower as well. Fred had come to understand the relationship those words implied, but most Boiseans didn&#x2019;t. Worse, they thought they <i>did</i> understand it.</p><p><i>Being ignorant is truly bliss compared to being misinformed, especially if you&#x2019;re aware of the depths of your own ignorance. As Mother says, it isn&#x2019;t what you don&#x2019;t know that will kill you, it&#x2019;s what you think you know that just isn&#x2019;t so.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, Mr. President,&#x201d; the officer said at last, saluting; he hadn&#x2019;t been invited to sit.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not President yet,&#x201d; Fred replied sharply. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a little matter of elections first. I expect to win them . . . but I also intend to do it fair and square.&#x201d;</p><p>The man looked very slightly anxious; he was in his thirties, with Brigadier&#x2019;s insignia on his loose olive&#x2013;green linsey&#x2013;woolsey field uniform of boots and pants and patch&#x2013;pocketed jacket. Fred wore the same kit, the uniform of the realm that called itself the United States of America and ruled much of Idaho from its center at Boise, but without marks of rank at all apart from the Stars&#x2013;and&#x2013;Stripes badge on the shoulder. That ostentatious plainness was a statement in itself.</p><p>&#x201c;But we have an agreement, sir?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly, Brigadier Roberts. Unless you insist on having the personal parts in writing? That could be embarrassing down the road, unless we altered some of the details.&#x201d;</p><p><i>So you&#x2019;d better hope I win the vote</i> went unspoken between them. <i>And use what influence you have to make sure I do. Someone else might not consider themselves bound by our negotiations here.</i></p><p>The man licked his lips; they were thin, like his face, and together with his cropped blond hair and pale yellowish eyes gave him the look of a wolf that had gone a little too long without a meal. Those eyes flicked towards the back of the big tent. The High King had never made any secret of the fact that one of the things the Sword gave him was the ability to tell truth from falsehood. By now, nearly everyone believed it.</p><p><i>Or more precisely, I can sense the intention to deceive, Rudi thought. The which means my simply standing here keeps him . . . relatively . . . honest.</i></p><p>Though with a man as fundamentally untruthful as this, whether <i>anything</i> he said was true at heart would be a matter for philosophers to split hairs over.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not, sir. I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if I didn&#x2019;t trust your word.&#x201d;</p><p><i>And oddly enough, he does trust Fred&#x2019;s word. Wise enough not to judge others by himself, at least.</i></p><p>Fred nodded. &#x201c;Report to my chief of staff, and we&#x2019;ll slot your men into the overall TOE. He&#x2019;ll show you where to plant the eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood and returned the brigadier&#x2019;s salute, then shook hands. The man left, his stride growing brisker with relief, and there was a clank as the armored guards outside the tent&#x2019;s entrance brought their big oval shields up and thumped the butts of their long iron&#x2013;shod throwing spears to the hard&#x2013;packed earth. Silence fell for a long moment, amid the smell of hot canvas and dust and horses and woodsmoke from the encampment beyond. There were sounds&#x2014;voices, someone counting cadence, the massed tramp of booted feet, iron on iron from a field smithy&#x2014;but they were curiously muffled.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like that deal at all,&#x201d; Fred said quietly, when the defector was well out of ear&#x2013;range, looking at his right hand and turning it back and forth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it for three&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half thousand men . . . to save three&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half thousand men . . . but I don&#x2019;t like it at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudi Mackenzie smiled wryly as he came forward and sat across from him.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t <i>like</i> it either, Fred. And neither of us <i>likes</i> fighting battles, but you do as you must, not as you would. You must have seen it with your father; I certainly did with Mother, by Nuada of the Silver Hand who favors Kings! It may mean <i>dying</i> for the people. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Fred ran a hand over his hair, which was cut short in a cap of soft black rings. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d actually prefer that, sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all <i>going</i> to die sometime, to be sure. More often ruling well means we have to do things like shaking hands and breaking bread with men we&#x2019;d rather put facedown in a dungheap with a boot to the back of their necks. The which hand&#x2013;shaking and bread&#x2013;breaking is nearly as unpleasant as death and wears harder on the soul.&#x201d;</p><p>Fred grinned in weary agreement and kneaded the back of his neck. &#x201c;Thor with me, this sort of thing wears you out worse than a march in armor. And that&#x2019;s an attractive image. The manure pile and the boot and his face, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudi nodded. &#x201c;And you can wash muck off your boot, but it&#x2019;s harder to get clean of <i>that</i> sort.&#x201d;</p><p>He jerked his head towards the entrance, the long copper&#x2013;gold hair swirling about his shoulders. Fred sighed and nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Should I have been more . . . tactful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you were about right, I&#x2019;d say. He&#x2019;d smell a trap if you were all hail&#x2013;fellow&#x2013;well&#x2013;met and inviting him to sit down for a yarn and a tankard of beer with a slap on the back in good fellowship. And he&#x2019;d despise you if he thought it was genuine. Best to make it a matter of business and advantage on both sides.&#x201d;</p><p>The king and his ally were both big young men only a year apart in age, with similar broad&#x2013;shouldered, long&#x2013;limbed builds, both with the smooth graceful movements of those raised to the sword and the tensile wariness of those who&#x2019;d also lived by it in lands beyond law. In other ways they differed. The younger son of Boise&#x2019;s first ruler had bluntly handsome broad features and skin of a pale toast color, legacy of his sire&#x2019;s part&#x2013;African blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it is to our mutual advantage,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;And he does have <i>some</i> virtues. He&#x2019;s smart enough to treat his men well enough that they&#x2019;ll follow him. Especially now that he&#x2019;s leading them in the direction they want to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That always makes it easier, to be sure,&#x201d; Rudi said.</p><p>The High King&#x2019;s eyes were a changeable blue&#x2013;green&#x2013;gray, brighter by contrast now as the setting sun turned the big command tent into a cave of umber gloom. He wore the pleated kilt of a Mackenzie in the Clan&#x2019;s green&#x2013;brown tartan, with a plaid pinned at his shoulder over a loose&#x2013;sleeved saffron&#x2013;colored linen shirt cinched at wrists and throat with drawstrings.</p><p>A sword hung at his right side from a broad belt, in shape a knight&#x2019;s long cut&#x2013;and&#x2013;thrust weapon with a shallow&#x2013;curved crescent guard and a double&#x2013;lobed hilt of black staghorn inlaid with silver knotwork. Its pommel was a globe cradled in a web of antlers, at first glance a perfect sphere of moon&#x2013;opal. Then if you looked closer it was like crystal, and within it curves that drew the vision deeper and deeper&#x2014;</p><p>Fred&#x2019;s eyes flicked aside from it, though he ...</p></p><h2>Cut &amp; Assemble an Early American Seaport: Easy-to-Make Paper Models (Cut &amp; Assemble Buildings in H-O Scale)</h2><p><p>Relive the excitement and bustle of life in an early New England seaport, where men unloaded barrels of whale oil from waiting boats, the smell of freshly caught clams cut through the salty air, and the bell of a distant lighthouse tolled a melancholy sound.

Weaving together personal anecdote, biological fact, philosophical doubt, cultural criticism, and the wisdom of an eclectic range of writers and thinkers--from Lucretius to Woody Allen--Shields expertly renders both a hilarious family portrait and a truly resonant meditation on mortality. The Thing About Life provokes us to contemplate the brevity and radiance of our own sojourn on earth and challenges us to rearrange our thinking in crucial and unexpected ways.</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, February 2008: </b> "After you turn 7, your risk of dying doubles every eight years." By your 80s, you "no longer even have a distinctive odor ... You're vanishing." "The brain of a 90-year-old is the same size as that of a 3-year-old." And it goes on and on. David Shields's litany of decay and decrepitude might have overwhelmed the age-sensitive reader (like this one), but <i>The Thing About Life Is That One Day You'll Be Dead</i> manages to transcend the maudlin by melding personal history with frank biological data about every stage of life, creating an "autobiography about my body" that seeks meaning in death, but moreover, life. Shields filters his frank--and usually foreboding--data through his own experience as a 51-year-old father with burgeoning back pain, contrasting his own gloomy tendencies with the defiant perspective of his own 97-year-old father, a man who has waged a lifelong, urgent battle against the infirmities of time. (If believed, his love life at age 70 was truly marvelous.) Interwoven with observations of philosophers from Cicero and Sophocles to Lauren Bacall and Woody Allen ("I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve immortality through not dying."), Shields's book is a surprisingly moving and life-affirming embrace of the human condition, where inevitable failures and frailties become "thrilling" and "liberating," rather than dour portents of The End. <i>--Jon Foro</i> <br><br> <br> <b>Amazon.com Guest Review: Danielle Trussoni</b><br> David Shields's <i>The Thing About Life is that One Day You&#x2019;ll Be Dead</i> is an addictively punchy, startlingly brilliant exploration of our most essential relationship--the one between parent and child. Shields juxtaposes a storm of astonishing facts about the development of the human body ("By the time you're 5, your head has attained 90 percent of its mature size; by 7, your brain reaches 90 percent of its maximum weight; by 9, 95 percent; during adolescence, 100 percent") with an intimate portrait of himself as a son and father. The result is a naked, honest, and often funny book that forces one to look clearly at the realities of the body--especially the burden that biology imposes upon our inner life--in a fresh and disturbing way. The writing is fast, postmodern, and filled with quotations from such diverse sources as Shields's back doctor and Tolstoy. The style might be dizzying in the hands of a less perceptive narrator, but Shields has the eye of an archeologist cataloging the bizarre traits of an ancient civilization. How Shields managed to compress the whole mess of love, family, genetics, and desire into this elegant, elemental book is a wonder. --Danielle Trussoni, author of <i>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</i> <br><br>David Shields's new book, Reality Hunger: A Manifesto, was published by Knopf in 2010.

His work has been translated into fifteen languages.</p><h2>The Walk</h2><p>In <i>The Walk,</i> William deBuys writes about personal loss and the power of the landscape to nurture the recovery of hope. The book consists of three interrelated essays that move from a period of strife in the author&#x2019;s life to a kind of limbo and eventually to a place of peace. The setting is deBuys&#x2019; small farm in New Mexico&#x2019;s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Each morning, he takes the same walk through the woods, arriving, as he describes in the first essay, at a clarity that comes from looking at the same vantage point for years. The middle essay, Geranium,&#x201d; takes its name from a mare deBuys had to put down, and whose remains become one with the forest. In the final essay, deBuys reflects on drought, the loss of a friend, and the resurgence of land and hope. Contemplative, compassionate, and quietly humorous, <i>The Walk</i> is nature writing at its finest.</p><p>Author and professor deBuys has been repeating the same journey "up one arroyo, down another, back by the river...and up through the farm," every day for the past 27 years. In chronicling that daily walk and the contemplation it stirs, deBuys (River of Traps) has created another eloquent document of life in the mountain valleys of New Mexico. Bringing the Southwestern countryside to brilliant life, deBuys provides history of the wildlife that roam it, the inhabitants who claimed it and the current residents deBuys lives among, as well as more personal stories like the end of his long marriage and his friend's death from lung cancer. Each walk is a play between solitude and communion that "lubricates the connections of thought" and leads to unexpected insights: "The walk is like a piece of music that I partly play and partly listen to...still trying to understand my part and how to play it." As he ponders, mountain peaks become prayers, forests become dreams and the whole of it becomes an unfolding mystery that deBuys scours for signs of meaning, hope and the elusive connection between mankind and the wilderness around them: "The landscape abounds with flaws, like those who walk it." Anyone who enjoys a saunter in the great outdoors will find this memoir brimming with rich pleasures. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.These days the meditative art of nature writing is often overshadowed by works of environmental concern and warning. Therefore, what bliss it is to encounter deBuys' beautifully crafted musings on the history and spirit of land he has long walked and cherished. On a small farm in northern New Mexico, deBuys has married, raised children, cared lovingly for horses, and learned the ways of water and earth, grass and elk. He has also studied evidence of the errors of our ways in the "testimony of the landscape." DeBuys contemplates the follies of pesticide use and wildfire policies, and takes measure of his painful solitude after the demise of his marriage and the death of friends. What is there to do, but to walk the land as he has for 27 years? After all, "walking helps the mind go out and the world come in, and brings us to our senses." A supple and silvery book, <i>The Walk</i> defines hope in terms of mountain and sky, river and pine, mindfulness and love. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Over the course of her musical life, she synthesized a wide range of musical genres including gospel, rhythm-and-blues, bebop, free jazz, Indian devotional song, and Western art music. Her childhood experiences playing for African-American congregations in Detroit, the ecstatic and avant-garde improvisations she performed on the bandstand with her husband John Coltrane, and her religious pilgrimages to India reveal themselves on more than twenty albums of original music for the Impulse and Warner Brothers labels. <br><br>In the late 1970s Alice Coltrane became a swami, directing an alternative spiritual community in Southern California. Exploring her transformation from Alice McLeod, Detroit church pianist and bebopper, to guru Swami Turiya Sangitananda, Monument Eternal illuminates her music and, in turn, reveals the exceptional fluidity of American religious practices in the second half of the twentieth century. Most of all, this book celebrates the hybrid music of an exceptional, boundary-crossing African-American artist.</p><p>FRANYA BERKMAN is an assistant professor in the Department of Music at Lewis &amp; Clark College."With an artistic vision that spanned the most archaic spirituals to the farthest-flung reaches of the cosmos, Alice Coltrane was much more than merely the wife of her legendary saxophonist husband. She was one of the most brilliant improvising artists that the 1960s produced, but her eclectic creativity was frequently derided, dismissed, or misunderstood. In this fascinating book, Franya Berkman makes the persuasive case that Alice Coltrane's music reflects a lifelong engagement with the divine element that often transcended the narrow implications of the word "jazz," and is most accurately understood in terms of her ongoing spiritual evolution. Richly contextualized, insightfully theorized, and musically rigorous, this work should contribute to a profound reappraisal of Alice Coltrane's legacy and contribution, of the often-neglected achievements of improvised music in the 1960s and 1970s, and of potent alter-narratives of African-American spirituality."&#x2015;Michael E. Veal, professor of ethnomusicology, Yale University<br><br>"Monument Eternal is a fascinating reading of the life and work of Alice Coltrane. This book will be of great value to jazz studies, women's studies, African American studies, and religious studies, as well as to everyday readers who will be fascinated by this portrait of an innovative artist who discovered new ways of connecting musical and spiritual practices."&#x2015;George Lewis, Case Professor of American Music, Columbia University</p><h2>Frankenstein Underground</h2><p>After a fight with Hellboy, Frankenstein's monster escapes the terrible Mexican laboratory where he was imprisoned and discovers strange creatures beneath the desert, where he'll learn some of the greatest secrets of the mystical world in the strangest Hellboy spinoff yet! <br><br>"It's intimidating as hell to take on an icon like the Frankenstein monster. I'm trying to do something that's true to the origin Mary Shelley created for the creature but also captures a bit of the feel that Boris Karloff brought to the role in the classic Universal films. At the same time I'm throwing the monster into an entirely new environment, so I think the result will be something new. It's an odd one, but ultimately will add an important new wrinkle to the Hellboy/B.P.R.D. world." --<br>Mike Mignola</p><p>Mike Mignola was born September 16, 1960 in Berkeley, California and grew up in nearby Oakland. His fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age and reading Dracula at age 13 introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore from which he has never recovered. In 1993 Mike moved to Dark Horse comics and created Hellboy, a half-demon occult detective who may or may not be the Beast of the Apocalypse. While the first story line Seed of Destruction, was co-written by John Byrne, Mike has continued writing the series himself. There are, at this moment, numerous Hellboy graphic novel collections with more on the way, several spin-off titles (<i>BPRD, Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien and Witchfinder</i>), three anthologies of prose stories, several novels, two animated films, and two live action films staring Ron Perlman. Hellboy has earned numerous comic industry awards and is published in a great many countries.

Throughout his life, Walt was a frequent and enthusiastic "tourist," visiting destinations around the United States of America and across the globe. Whether attending a premiere, supervising a film production, or simply vacationing with his family, the "All-American" Walt became a citizen of the world. From Denmark to Argentina, England to Greece, Austria, Chile, Canada, France . . . all of them welcomed Walt as an emissary of his good name, good works, and good reputation. In <i>Travels with Walt Disney: A Photographic Voyage Around the World</i>, seldom-seen and never-before-published photographs are showcased along with eyewitness recollections and enlightening anecdotes, arranged into a one-of-a-kind "travel journal" as if Walt himself might have documented these exciting excursions in one special place to keep the memories alive and to share with readers.</p><p>Jeff Kurtti is a leading authority on The Walt Disney Company, its founder, and its history. He is the author of more than twenty books, a writer-director of award-winning documentary content, and a respected public speaker. A Seattle, Washington native, Kurtti worked as a production coordinator on the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival, followed by two years as the assistant to the president of the California Institute of the Arts. For several years, he worked for Walt Disney Imagineering, the theme park design division of The Walt Disney Company, and then for the Corporate Special Projects department of Disney.

Once in Vienna with the late Roy E. Disney, we got into a bit of financial challenge when we discovered that there was a problem using credit cards in Austria, and that we needed a very large amount of cash to cover our expenses. Roy and I were a bit flummoxed, and I met with the elderly Manager of our hotel. She told me a glorious story of Walt staying in the very same hotel when he made his two beloved films set there, one about the Lipizzaner Stallions and one about the Vienna Boy Choir. She said Walt helped give Austria pride again after WWII, and that, of course, the hotel would front us any cash we needed. She 'knew' we were good for it. I've found that as a longtime Disney employee, everywhere I go people know of Walt Disney. His reputation and extraordinary achievements seem universal. What surprised me in Jeff Kurtti's new book, <em>Travels with Walt Disney</em>, is that Walt himself was a world traveler, crossing the country and circling the globe for his myriad projects and vacations with his family.

Goodman was a writer and thinker who broke every mold and did it brilliantly&#x2014;he was a novelist, poet, and a social theorist, among a host of other things&#x2014;and the book&#x2019;s surprise success established him as one of America&#x2019;s most unusual and trenchant critics, combining vast learning, an astute mind, utopian sympathies, and a wonderfully hands-on way with words.<br><br>For Goodman, the unhappiness of young people was a concentrated form of the unhappiness of American society as a whole, run by corporations that provide employment (if and when they do) but not the kind of meaningful work that engages body and soul.

In this challenging and provocative book, Gordon T. Smith contends that a chief cause of spiritual immaturity in the evangelical church is an inadequate theology of conversion. Conversion, he says, involves more than a release from the consequences of sin--the goal is spiritual transformation. But there is little transformation without a complete and authentic conversion. The key is beginning well. In this age of false starts and stunted growth, maturing Christians need help reflecting on and interpreting their own religious experience. Christian leaders need to rethink the way that conversions happen. <em>Beginning Well</em> is a catalyst toward this end. Surveying Scripture, spiritual autobiographies and a broad range of theologies of conversion (Protestant and Catholic, Reformed and Wesleyan), the author seeks to foster in the Christian community a dynamic language of conversion that leads to spiritual transformation and mature Christian living. In the process he moves us from a short-sighted "minimalist" view to one that recognizes seven elements necessary for good conversions. This book--a stirring call to rethink the relationship between conversion and transformation--is a must read for pastors, evangelists, spiritual directors, seminary professors and others who are concerned about the nurture and development of Christian converts, and the nature of authentic religious experience.</p><p>Gordon T.

In the interim, we have received reports of similar attacks on a Saurian transport and an Arcturian trading post, both of which were able to repel the assaults&#x2014;though not without casualties in the latter case. Whoever these beings are, they seem to be targeting races capable of putting up a fight . . . and their own skill seems to be improving. As they draw nearer to Federation space, a confrontation with Starfleet increasingly appears inevitable.<br> <br>The First Federation clearly has knowledge of these beings, but our attempts to contact Lieutenant David Bailey, our unofficial ambassador to the First Federation, have proven unsuccessful. The Enterprise is proceeding toward the First Federation border in hopes of establishing direct contact with their representatives. In the meantime, the office of the Federation diplomatic commissioner has requested a full briefing on the matter.<br> <br>The briefing was at 1900 hours, late by the Enterprise&#x2019;s clocks, but that allowed Kirk to assemble all the senior officers who had been present for the first encounter with Balok: himself, Spock, McCoy, Scott, Uhura, and Sulu. They met in the largest briefing room, the one with a wall screen in addition to the smaller three-sided viewer in the table, so that Commissioner Gopal could see them all at once. Damayanti Gopal was a strong-featured woman in her mid-forties, only recently promoted to diplomatic commissioner after spending two years as assistant commissioner. Kirk had briefly known her predecessor in that post, Nancy Hedford, and had found her to be a rather prickly and un�diplomatic individual, at least on the surface. So far, Gopal did not seem much different, making Kirk wonder what standards the previous commissioner had employed to select his deputies.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have, of course, read all the reports on the Enterprise&#x2019;s initial contact with Commander Balok and the Fesarius,&#x201d; Gopal said on the viewscreen. &#x201c;What concerns me is the lack of follow-up. Your Lieutenant Bailey has had three years to learn more about the First Federation, but he hasn&#x2019;t found the location of their homeworld or even their true name for themselves. We&#x2019;re forced to call them Fesarians for lack of anything better!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You must understand, Commissioner,&#x201d; Spock replied, &#x201c;that Commander Balok&#x2019;s people have good reason to be cautious. They are a neotenous species, retaining the size and appearance of small humanoid children well into adulthood. Many hostile cultures would be quick to take advantage of such physically fragile beings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Their reactions go beyond caution, Commander Spock. They embrace deception and concealment and use highly aggressive measures to defend their territory. The buoy you first encountered provided no warning, merely clung to you and bathed your ship in lethal radiation until you were forced to destroy it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we were able to destroy it,&#x201d; Spock pointed out. &#x201c;With their technology, they could easily have shielded it against our phasers. The buoy was part of a test to assess our&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your peaceful intentions, yes.&#x201d; Gopal turned to Kirk. &#x201c;I do wonder, Captain, why you thought the best way to demonstrate those was to push forward into the territory they obviously wished to fence off. You must have known that would provoke a further response.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was counting on it, Commissioner,&#x201d; the captain �replied. &#x201c;We were peaceful, but we didn&#x2019;t yet know whether they were. Given the level of technology on display, I decided it was imperative that we learn more about what we were facing.&#x201d; He gave a small smile. &#x201c;Consider it a chess move. You have to advance your pieces onto the board to get your opponent to reveal their strategy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And yet we still have more questions than answers. With the power of their technology, their effortless ability to shut down a starship&#x2019;s power and rifle through its memory banks, why do they feel the need for all this protective camouflage? A giant starship with only one person aboard. A threatening face and voice that turn out to be mere �puppetry. This is a systematic pattern of deceit, and you had no guarantee the tricks would end once Commander Balok allowed you to board his ship and see his true face. And yet you had no problem assigning your most in�experienced bridge officer as the Federation&#x2019;s &#x2018;ambassador&#x2019; to these people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Bailey was an eager volunteer. I felt it would give him valuable seasoning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mere hours before, you&#x2019;d ordered him off the bridge when he became insubordinate and suffered a panic attack. Perhaps you were simply eager to foist him off on some other ship&#x2019;s captain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk clung to his patience. &#x201c;I wanted to give him a chance to make up for that mistake. Something he was strongly motivated to do. I was that young once myself, Commissioner. I was cocky, and I made my share of mistakes.&#x201d; He tried to ignore Doctor McCoy, whose expression almost audibly countered, Was? &#x201c;But I learned a great deal from assignments where I spent time living among other cultures, getting to know them. They brought me valuable perspective, showed me there was always another way of looking at any problem&#x2014;and at myself.&#x201d; He reflected on the individuals he had befriended on those missions, leaders whose example had helped guide him in becoming a better officer and a better man&#x2014;Tyree of Neural, Ren&#x2019;xaan of Arkoni, King Stevvin of Shad. He had sensed a similar wisdom in Balok and had hoped the little trickster could play a similar role for David Bailey.<br> <br>&#x201c;But what exactly has Bailey done with that second chance?&#x201d; Gopal challenged. &#x201c;Hit wall after wall trying to pierce the First Federation&#x2019;s veil of secrecy. Been stuck in an unofficial ambassadorial posting because the Fesarians unequivocally refuse to deal with a more qualified representative. Could it be that they prefer dealing with him because his inexperience makes him easy to manipulate and mislead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, Commissioner,&#x201d; McCoy put in. &#x201c;Maybe I got the wrong memo, but I was under the impression we were here to talk about these aliens that happen to look like Balok&#x2019;s mechanical scarecrow, not dissect Lieutenant Bailey&#x2019;s career.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is exactly my concern, Doctor. Balok claimed his &#x2018;scarecrow,&#x2019; as you put it, was a mythical construct.&#x201d; She checked a note on her data slate. &#x201c;The Hyde to his Jekyll, he called it. I&#x2019;m not sure whether I&#x2019;m more troubled by the idea that he could have assimilated the Enterprise&#x2019;s databanks rapidly enough to be able to make that allusion, or by the implication that his people may have already known more about us than they admitted. In any case, it is now evident that Balok was lying&#x2014;that these creatures are far from mythical, and that the First Federation&#x2019;s members are more physically intimidating than we were led to believe. Perhaps Balok is not the mature form of his species after all, or perhaps their federation includes a more aggressive race among its members.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lieutenant Uhura pursed her lips in thought. &#x201c;There is another possibility, Commissioner. Balok&#x2019;s people chose the image of these beings to frighten. To represent a deadly and implacable foe. So maybe it represents something that they are afraid of. Maybe they&#x2019;re even the reason the First Federation is so cautious with aliens.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t the Betelgeusians&#x2019; report indicate that they used the same technology as the Fesarians, though?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the same, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Montgomery Scott replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve reviewed the &#x2019;Geusians&#x2019; scans of the attack and the wreckage they recovered. It&#x2019;s based on the same principles, for the most part, but it&#x2019;s a different application. Cruder in some ways, but in other ways just . . . different.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say they and Balok&#x2019;s people have a history, but I cannae say what kind of history. They could be allies, sure. Or they could be enemies, spying on each other and reverse-engineering each other&#x2019;s technology. How do you think the current crop o&#x2019; Romulan birds-of-prey ended up with warp nacelles so much like ours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I concede that&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; Commissioner Gopal spoke up, her manner making it clear that she intended to stay in control of the conversation. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s all speculation until we can convince the Fesarians to cough up some real answers. We&#x2019;ve indulged their mysterious ways for far too long, and now we might be facing a new threat on our border. Captain Kirk, when you make contact, I expect you to press for answers. No more kid gloves. Threaten to withdraw Bailey if they don&#x2019;t start practicing full disclosure. His Starfleet commission is still active, so you could order him to return with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk replied with care. &#x201c;Commissioner . . . it wasn&#x2019;t easy to get through the First Federation&#x2019;s defenses the first time. I&#x2019;m concerned that if we attempt strong-arm tactics, it will simply drive them into retreat&#x2014;or worse. If they decide the Enterprise is genuinely a threat, we may not be able to handle their response.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As you said, Captain, in chess you have to risk your pieces to expose the opponent&#x2019;s strategy. It&#x2019;s time to stop probing with pawns like Bailey and move into the middle game. Because these &#x2018;scarecrow&#x2019; attacks might just be their opening gambit.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Gopal signed off, Kirk turned to his first officer. &#x201c;Spock, your assessment?&#x201d;<br> <br>The half-Vulcan raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Her extended metaphor was somewhat labored.&#x201d;<br> <br>His remark broke the tension and brought a laugh to Kirk and the others&#x2014;no doubt Spock&#x2019;s intention, though he would never admit it. McCoy played along. &#x201c;Blast it, Spock, save the literary criticism for poetry night. Do you think Gopal knows what she&#x2019;s talking about? Or is she just the latest blowhard commissioner in a long line?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is a duly appointed Federation official, Doctor, and we are obliged to defer to her judgment on diplomatic matters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bull! We&#x2019;re the ones on the front lines. Jim&#x2019;s got the full authority of a Federation ambassador when he needs it. That&#x2019;s how he was able to appoint Bailey as one to begin with!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet the commissioner does have a point,&#x201d; Spock continued. &#x201c;In chess, or indeed in poker, one must be willing to provoke a response from the opponent. I believe the expression is, &#x2018;You must pay to see the other&#x2019;s cards.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But Balok&#x2019;s people aren&#x2019;t the opponents, are they?&#x201d; Sulu asked. &#x201c;It just doesn&#x2019;t make sense that they&#x2019;d be behind these attacks. Why go around operating robotic puppets of these warrior creatures if they&#x2019;re actually real and on their side?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps, Mister Sulu. But Spock&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;Either way, they&#x2019;re hiding something from us, and we need to find out what it is. We&#x2019;re on friendly terms, yes, but guardedly so at best. They&#x2019;re very slow to trust, and they&#x2019;re undoubtedly keeping a great many secrets. They haven&#x2019;t even begun to share any of their technology with us, for one thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; Scott said. &#x201c;And I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder that that&#x2019;s part o&#x2019; the reason the commissioner&#x2019;s so eager to dig deeper into their secrets. I know I&#x2019;d love to get my hands on the Fesarius&#x2019;s specs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you were right, too, Jim,&#x201d; McCoy said. &#x201c;Push them too hard and we may lose what little trust we&#x2019;ve gained. And think about the consequences to Bailey&#x2019;s career. Gopal&#x2019;s already written him off as a failure. We swoop in there and pull him out, and he&#x2019;s probably done in Starfleet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And yet,&#x201d; Kirk answered patiently, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a band of marauders out there picking fights with anyone they run across. And Balok&#x2019;s people know them somehow. We have to tread carefully, but we need to get answers&#x2014;before these marauders get better at hitting the mark.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cube spun on the viewscreen like an angular top, flashing bright colors at the Enterprise as it blocked the starship&#x2019;s path. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s certainly . . . festive,&#x201d; was the judgment of Pavel Chekov, who was seeing this sight for the first time.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re meant to be noticed,&#x201d; Hikaru Sulu bantered back. &#x201c;Think of it as a very aggressive stoplight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Uhura,&#x201d; Kirk said, &#x201c;transmit the recognition code to the buoy.&#x201d; And let&#x2019;s hope Balok was being �honest when he gave it to us, he added to himself.<br> <br>As Uhura acknowledged his order and worked her console, the turbolift doors swooshed open and Doctor McCoy entered the bridge. Multicolored lights played across his face as he studied the image on the view�screen and frowned. &#x201c;Is that thing going to behave itself, or do I need to have Nurse Chapel prepare hyronalin �injections?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No increase in baseline radiation as yet, Doctor,&#x201d; Spock said, not looking up from his hooded viewer. &#x201c;I shall let you know if that changes, however.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk glanced up at McCoy as the doctor took his wonted spot to the left of the captain&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Have you had a chance to review Bailey&#x2019;s reports?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br> <br>The doctor kept a wary eye on the twirling buoy as he replied, &#x201c;I have.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your assessment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re certainly thorough, as far as they go. I&#x2019;ve learned a lot about the workings of the Fesarius and its crew. Like the fact that it has a crew. I remember Balok being rather insistent that he had none. Another one of his bluffs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To be fair, the others did retreat in their pilot vessels before the Fesarius confronted us,&#x201d; Kirk replied. &#x201c;So he was technically telling the truth, at that moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, standard contact procedure, per Bailey&#x2019;s reports.&#x201d; Paraphrasing those reports as best he could, he adopted a singsong tone. &#x201c;An orbship like the Fesarius is primarily a freighter and asteroid miner, large enough to support its crew for years away from home. But that size makes it valuable as an intimidating presence on the borders when necessary.&#x201d; He went on more normally. &#x201c;But where home might be, or why they spend so much time away from it, is another matter. Bailey&#x2019;s reports get thinner and thinner with time&#x2014;I can almost hear him getting more frustrated as he tries to find something new to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk frowned. &#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;s handling it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean, did you make a mistake giving him this responsibility?&#x201d; He quirked a brow. &#x201c;Honestly, Jim, I&#x2019;m impressed that he didn&#x2019;t demand a transfer a year or two ago. It&#x2019;s a thankless job, but he&#x2019;s stuck with it and been as diligent as his hosts would permit.&#x201d; He threw an im�patient glance at the screen. &#x201c;And you know how tough it is to convince them to lower their guard,&#x201d; he said more loudly, as if challenging the buoy directly.<br> <br>And it seemed to work. &#x201c;The buoy is withdrawing,&#x201d; Spock announced, mere seconds before its retreat became obvious. &#x201c;We are evidently cleared to proceed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk threw McCoy an impressed look, and the doctor bounced smugly on his heels. &#x201c;Well. It&#x2019;s about time somebody around here started listening to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What was that, Doctor?&#x201d; Kirk grinned at McCoy&#x2019;s sour look. &#x201c;Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d; Moments later, at Sulu&#x2019;s command, the ship around them hummed with power as the warp engines engaged and drove it forward. &#x201c;Entering First Federation space.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some space,&#x201d; Chekov said, shaking his head. &#x201c;I do not see why they make such a fuss over it. There is nothing here. Virtually no inhabited planets to speak of.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That we know of,&#x201d; Sulu added. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thi...</p><h2>The Worthing Saga</h2><p><p><b> Orson Scott Card is "a master of the art of storytelling" (<i>Booklist</i>), and<i> The Worthing Saga</i> is a story that only he could have written. </b></p><p>It was a miracle of science that permitted human beings to live, if not forever, then for a long, long time.

It was as if an ancient and comfortable presence left them, one that they had never noticed until it was gone, and no one knew what to make of it at first, though all knew at once that something had changed deep at the heart of the world. No one saw the brief flare in the star named Argos; it would be years before astronomers would connect the Day of Pain with the End of Worthing. And by then the change was done, the worlds were broken, and the golden age was over.<br>In Lared&#x2019;s village, the change came while they slept. That night there were no shepherds in their dreams. Lared&#x2019;s little sister, Sala, awoke screaming in terror that Grandma was dead, Grandma is dead!<br>Lared sat up in his truckle bed, trying to dispel his own dreams, for in them he had seen his father carry Grandma to the gave--but that had been long ago, hadn&#x2019;t it? Father stumbled from the wooden bedstead where he and Mother slept. Not since Sala had been weaned had anyone cried out in the night. Was she hungry?<br>&#x201c;Grandma died tonight, like a fly in the fire she died!&#x201d;<br>Like a squirrel in the fox&#x2019;s teeth, thought Lared. Like a lizard in the cat&#x2019;s mouth, trembling.<br>&#x201c;Of course she&#x2019;s dead,&#x201c; Father said, &#x201c;but not tonight.&#x201d; He took her in his vast blacksmith&#x2019;s arms and held her. &#x201c;Why do you weep now, when Grandma has been dead for such a long time?&#x201d; But Sala wept on, as if the grief were great and new.<br>Then Lared looked at Grandma&#x2019;s old bed. &#x201c;Father,&#x201c; he whispered. Again, &#x201c;Father.&#x201d; For there lay her corpse, still new, still stiffening, though Lared so clearly remembered her burial long ago.<br>Father laid Sala back in her truckle bed, where she burrowed down against the woven straw side, in order not to watch. Lared watched, though, as his father touched the straw tick beside his old mother&#x2019;s body. &#x201c;Not cold yet,&#x201c; he murmured. Then he cried out in fear and agony, &#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; Which woke all the sleepers, even the travelers in the room upstairs; they all came into the sleeping room.<br>&#x201c;Do you see it!&#x201d; cried Father. &#x201c;Dead a year, at least, and here&#x2019;s her body not yet cold in her own bed!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dead a year!&#x201d; cried the old clerk, who had arrived late in the afternoon yesterday, on a donkey. &#x201c;Nonsense! She served the soup last night. Don&#x2019;t you remember how she joked with me that if my bed was too cold, your wife would come up and warm it, and if it was too warm, <em>she</em>would sleep with me?&#x201d;<br>Lared tried to sort out his memories. &#x201c;I remember that, but I remember that she said that long, long ago, and yet I remember she said it to you, and I never saw you before last night.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I buried you!&#x201d; Father cried, and then he knelt at Grandma&#x2019;s bed and wept. &#x201c;I buried you, and forgot you, and here you are to grieve me!&#x201d;<br>Weeping. It was an unaccustomed sound in the village of Flat Harbor, and no one knew what to do about it. Only hungry infants made such cries, and so Mother said, &#x201c;Elmo, will you eat something? Let me fetch you something to eat.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; shouted Elmo. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see my mother&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d; And he caught his wife by the arm and flung her roughly away. She fell over the stool and struck her head against the table.<br>This was worse than the corpse lying in the bed, stiff as a dried-out bird. For never in Lared&#x2019;s life had he seen one human being do harm to another. Father too was aghast at his own temper. &#x201c;Thano, Thanalo, what have I done?&#x201d; He scarcely knew how to comfort her as she lay weeping softly on the floor. No one had needed comfort in all their lives. To all the others, Father said, &#x201c;I was so angry. I have never been so angry before, and yet what did she do? I&#x2019;ve never felt such a rage, and yet she did me no harm!&#x201d;<br>Who could answer him? Something was bitterly wrong with the world, they could see that; they had all felt anger in the past, but till now something had always come between the thought and the act, and calmed them. Now, tonight, that calm was gone. They could feel it in themselves, nothing soothing their fear, nothing telling them worldlessly, All is well.<br>Sala raised her head above the edge of her bed and said, &#x201c;The angels are gone, Mama. No one watches us anymore.&#x201d;<br>Mother got up from the floor and stumbled over her daughter. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be foolish, child. There are no angels, except in dreams.&#x201d;<br>There is a lie in my mind, Lared said to himself. The traveler came last night, and Grandma spoke to him just as he said, and yet my memory is twisted, for I remember the traveler speaking yesterday, but Grandma answering long ago. Something has bent my memories, for I remember grieving at her graveside, and yet her grave has not been dug.<br>Mother looked up at Father in awe. &#x201c;My elbow still hurts, where it struck the floor,&#x201c; she said. &#x201c;It still hurts very much.&#x201d;<br>A hurt that lasted! Who had heard of such a thing! And when she lifted her arm, there was a raw and bleeding scrape on it.<br>&#x201c;Have I killed you?&#x201d; asked Father, wonderingly.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201c; said Mother. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then why does it bleed?&#x201d;<br>The old clerk trembled and nodded and his voice quivered as he spoke. &#x201c;I have read the books of ancient times,&#x201c; he began, and all eyes turned to him. &#x201c;I have read the books of ancient times, and in them the old ones spoke of wounds that bleed like slaughtered cattle, and great griefs when the living suddenly are dead, and anger that turns to blows among people. But that was long, long ago, when men were still animals, and God was young and inexperienced.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What does this mean, then?&#x201d; asked Father. He was not a bookish man, and so even more than Lared he thought that men who knew books had answers.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201c; said the clerk. &#x201c;But perhaps it means that God has gone away, or that he no longer cares for us.&#x201d;<br>Lared studied the corpse of Grandma, lying on her bed. &#x201c;Or is he dead?&#x201d; Lared asked.<br>&#x201c;How can God die?&#x201d; the old clerk asked with withering scorn. &#x201c;He had all the power in the universe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then doesn&#x2019;t he have the power to die if he wants to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why should I speak with children of things like this?&#x201d; The clerk got up to go upstairs, and the other travelers took that as a signal to return to bed.<br>But Father did not go to bed: he knelt by his old mother&#x2019;s body until daybreak. And Lared also did not sleep, because he was trying to remember what he had felt inside himself yesterday that he did not feel now, for something was strange in the way his own eyes looked out upon the world, and yet he could not remember how it was before. Only Sala and Mother slept, and they slept together in Mother&#x2019;s and Father&#x2019;s bed.<br>Before dawn, Lared got up and walked over to his mother, and saw that a scab had formed on her arm, and the bleeding had stopped. Comforted, he dressed himself and went out to milk the ewe, which was near the end of its milk. Every bit of milk was needed for the cheese press and the butter churn--winter was coming, and this morning, as the cold breeze whipped at Lared&#x2019;s hair, this morning he looked to winter with dread. Until today he had always looked at the future like a cow looking at the pasture, never imagining drought or snow. Now it was possible for old women to be found dead in their beds. Now it was possible for Father to be angry and knock Mother to the floor. Now it was possible for Mother to bleed like an animal. And so winter was more than just a season of inactivity. It was the end of hope.<br>The ewe perked up at something, a sound perhaps that Lared was too human to hear. He stopped milking and looked up, and saw in the western sky a great light, which hovered in the air like a star that had lost its bearings and needed help to get back home. Then the light sank down below the level of the trees across the river, and it was gone. Lared did not know at first what it might be. Then he remembered the word <em>starship</em>from school and wondered. Starships did not come to Flat Harbor, or even to this continent, or even, more than once a decade, to this world. There was nothing here to carry away to somewhere else, nothing lacking here that only other worlds could possibly supply. Why, then, would a starship come here now? Don&#x2019;t be a fool, Lared, he told himself. It was a shooting star, but on this strange morning you made too much of it, because you are afraid.<br>At dawn, Flat Harbor came awake, and others gradually made the discovery that had come to Lared&#x2019;s family in the night. They came, as they always did in cold weather, to Elmo&#x2019;s house, with its great table and indoor kitchen. They were not surprised to find that Elmo had not yet built up the fire in his forge.<br>&#x201c;I scalded myself on the gruel this morning,&#x201c; said Dinno, Mother&#x2019;s closest friend.

These texts, which are undoubtedly among the last things he wrote, take on the character of a legacy, a spiritual testament.

What he had set out in detail in numerous books over five decades, he summarizes here in contemplative plainness and simplicity.</p><p>All the characteristics that make von Balthasar's work so distinctive and valuable are to be found here: breadth of vision, loveliness of style, and an intuitive-contemporary passion that allows him to "pray intellectually and think 'cordially'."</p><p>In his warm and extensive introduction to the book, Medard Kehl speaks of von Balthasar's "unclouded, almost childlike joy in the richness and beauty of the Mystery" of the threefold God, which "is evidenced in his interpretation of the creed."</p></p><p><b>Hans Urs von Balthasar&nbsp;</b>(1905&#x2013;1988) was a Swiss theologian widely regarded as one of the greatest theologians and spiritual writers of modern times.

Before we were born, we shared Mama&#x2019;s belly, splitting the resources so equally that we weighed the exact same amount at birth. The story of our arrival was our bedtime story for years and years. How the doctor didn&#x2019;t realize there were two of us until nine minutes after I was born, when you followed me into life. (How you have always loved a good surprise!) How in those nine minutes, Mama and Papa had already named me Annabelle. How they were so shocked at your arrival, they didn&#x2019;t think to come up with a second name. Instead, they split mine in two. I became Anna, you Belle.</p><p>Twelve years later, we share more than a name. To strangers, we&#x2019;re identical. We have the same straight brown hair cropped to the same place beneath our ears, the same gray-green eyes, the same pattern to our forehead wrinkles when we squint without our same-prescription glasses. We have the same height, the same weight, the same narrow heels that make buying shoes the same type of challenge. Save the mole on my left elbow that you lack, we are mirror replicas. So, like a name, we share our appearance.</p><p>We certainly don&#x2019;t share a personality. You are carefree and adventurous, while I am careful and cautious. You are quick to laugh, but also quick to cry. Your emotions flap back and forth like clothes drying on the line. We are both 12 but in many ways you are like our baby sister Mina, lashing out in anger in one moment, then jumping with delight the next, your hurt erased at the sight of something pretty.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t be angry at that comparison. You are the fun twin, the mischievous twin, the reckless and funny and passionate twin. I am the dull twin, the quiet twin, the responsible and reserved twin. I&#x2019;m more careful than you, and more deliberate. I compared you to Mina, but you always compare me to Oliver. That is a compliment as well. Oliver is only 4, but he&#x2019;s wiser than most adults. We all love his story too. How he had so many ear infections as a baby that Mama used to worry he wouldn&#x2019;t hear. How he now hears every whisper, and how nothing escapes his big blue eyes. We know it&#x2019;s more than that, however. He understands. People, ideas, feelings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s as though the tubes the doctor put in his ears made a path all the way to his heart. I am quiet like Oliver, and I like to think I share at least some of his intuition.</p><p>Of course I&#x2019;ve arrived back at sharing. With so many brothers and sisters, we know nothing besides sharing. Me, you, Oliver, Mina, Greta (who is every bit 9), and Kurt, now 14&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our house was quite full enough with 8 people. When the occupation pushed Grandmother and Grandfather to move in, it became nearly unbearable for us all. I know you too have wished to have something for yourself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a bed, a hairbrush, a whole potato, or an entire magazine. The only thing I&#x2019;ve ever had for me and me alone are my thoughts. I try to keep them for just me, but in that I even fail, for you, Belle, know me to my core. You speak for me and through me, and often (does this happen to you?) it&#x2019;s as though I don&#x2019;t know my own opinion until I hear you speak yours.&nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve often wished for some time alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some moments, belongings, or experiences just for me. I wanted to be like the magician who performs at the Luxembourg Fair and make my 5 siblings, even you, even Oliver, vanish.</p><p>Now here I am, crossing the ocean, my wish come regrettably true. Who is vanishing, you or me?</p><p><b><br>Chapter 1</b><br>October 2014</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited!&#x201d;</p><p>Parker Applebaum dangled two postcards over the low shelves in the synagogue library. Even though I couldn&#x2019;t see her from my spot on the floor with Madeline, I knew it was Parker because there was a giant photo of her face taking up half the postcard. Madeline and I looked at each other and suppressed giggles. The picture looked like it was meant for a department store ad. Parker&#x2019;s long red hair was blowing in the wind, and her mouth was open in a hearty grin, like the photographer&#x2014;no doubt a professional one&#x2014;had caught her mid-laugh.</p><p>Madeline squinted at the postcard. &#x201c;Where are her braces?&#x201d;</p><p>Parker&#x2019;s actual face appeared over the bookshelf. &#x201c;Photoshopped out,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;This photographer&#x2019;s amazing. He doesn&#x2019;t usually do bat mitzvahs, but he&#x2019;s willing to do mine because we used him for my modeling portfolio. Let me know if you want his number. I can probably get you guys in too. <i>And</i>,&#x201d; Parker sang, her lips curling up, &#x201c;guess who else is invited.&#x201d; She cocked her head in the direction of the tables in the center of the library.</p><p>&#x201c;The whole class?&#x201d; Madeline deadpanned.</p><p>The corners of Parker&#x2019;s lips dropped. &#x201c;I was talking to Imani,&#x201d; she said. She smiled at me and did a double-raise of her eyebrows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m inviting Ethan Bloom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, trying to sound casual. Ethan and I are both on our school tennis team, and ever since Parker heard him compliment my backhand a couple weeks ago, she&#x2019;s been convinced that he likes me. I&#x2019;m not as convinced. It&#x2019;s not like he complimented my serve (which stinks). Everyone compliments my backhand, because it&#x2019;s killer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to sit you and Ethan at the same table,&#x201d; Parker said with some more eyebrow wiggling.</p><p>Mrs. Coleman&#x2019;s face appeared above Parker&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Girls,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Back to your projects, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Parker smiled and handed Mrs. Coleman a postcard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited, Mrs. Coleman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;December sixth,&#x201d; our teacher said without needing to look. &#x201c;Will you have your haftorah ready by then? How about the research project you&#x2019;re supposed to be working on as we speak?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah.&#x201d; Parker rolled her eyes and reminded us, &#x201c;December sixth,&#x201d; before walking away.</p><p>Madeline and I went back to our Holocaust books. As if we didn&#x2019;t have to do enough to prepare for our bat mitzvahs (write a speech, know all the prayers, read nine lines of Torah, <i>sing </i>a long haftorah portion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.), we each had to research some aspect of the Holocaust. Like we hadn&#x2019;t heard enough about the Holocaust every year of our lives. I&#x2019;m usually pretty good about doing classwork, even for Hebrew school, but this assignment was seriously uninspiring. We couldn&#x2019;t even use the internet to look stuff up the easy way; Mrs. Coleman was making us use actual books, which was why our Hebrew school class had permanently relocated from a classroom to the synagogue library.</p><p>Not wanting to think about Ethan or my Holocaust project, I waited till Mrs. Coleman was out of earshot and then poked Madeline with Parker&#x2019;s postcard. &#x201c;Are you going to have your photo on your invitations?&#x201d; I whispered.</p><p>Madeline blew air through her lips, like a bike tire deflating. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. We&#x2019;re not even going to do paper invites; wastes too many trees.&#x201d;</p><p>Figures. Madeline&#x2019;s parents are green to the extreme.</p><p>&#x201c;When are you going to tell your parents what you want for your present?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I sighed and leaned back into the bookshelf. Instead of having a blowout party for my bat mitzvah (like Parker) or a tasteful luncheon (like Madeline), I&#x2019;m going to get a big present. My parents said they&#x2019;d get me whatever gift I want, within reason. I know exactly what I want, but so far I&#x2019;ve only worked up the nerve to tell Madeline. I also told Madeline to make sure I don&#x2019;t chicken out of asking, and boy, was she keeping that promise.</p><p>&#x201c;Imani.&#x201d; She poked my arm with her pointer finger. &#x201c;Just tell them. They said you can have anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Within reason,&#x201d; I reminded her.</p><p>&#x201c;What could be more reasonable than wanting to know who you are?&#x201d; Madeline flipped through the pages of the book she was holding. It was full of old pictures of white people, emaciated, with sunken cheeks and resigned eyes. &#x201c;Remember when we used to look at that <i>Children of the World</i> book? The one with the people from all different countries?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; I said, as though just now remembering. &#x201c;You used to hold it up next to me and try to see which country my ancestors might be from.&#x201d; This was always a one-way game, since there&#x2019;s nothing mysterious about where Madeline gets her appearance. She looks exactly like her mom, only shorter.</p><p>&#x201c;We thought that girl from Ghana could be your twin!&#x201d; Madeline laughed, which made Mrs. Coleman appear again.</p><p>&#x201c;Mayim. Emunah.&#x201d; She said our Hebrew names like she was too tired to be stern, which made me feel worse than if she&#x2019;d just yelled at us.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We looked back at our books, but now my mind was with the <i>Children of the World</i>. That book was about how everyone&#x2019;s the same on the inside, but I always liked it more for how different everyone looks on the outside. In my town, everyone looks pretty much the same, and it&#x2019;s not like me. Nobody in my own family even looks like me. My mom is tall and sturdy, like she&#x2019;s built to survive a Nordic winter. My dad is also tall, but angular and spindly, like he&#x2019;d have to spend that Nordic winter huddled close to the fireplace (probably stocked with wood my mom had chopped). They both have fair skin, thick brown hair, and icy blue eyes.</p><p>My brother Jaime&#x2019;s skin is a shade darker. His eyes are brown, and his hair is a shiny black. Not surprising, given that he&#x2019;s adopted from Guatemala.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s me. I&#x2019;m short and skinny. My arms and legs look like toothpicks no matter how much tennis I play or how many bowls of tortellini I eat. (My records, by the way, are fifteen hours of tennis in one week and five bowls of tortellini in one sitting. I like tennis, but I&#x2019;m obsessed with tortellini.) My complexion&#x2019;s a little darker than Jaime&#x2019;s, but my light brown eyes are flecked with green. My hair is soft and springy, with tight coils that extend up and out, challenging gravity. Parker says I look &#x201c;exotic&#x201d;&#x2014;she&#x2019;s actually used that word, straight out of an ad for some honeymoon resort&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s always lamenting that she doesn&#x2019;t. She says I&#x2019;d get a ton of modeling jobs if I wanted them. Apparently, talent agents want people whose ethnicity &#x201c;keeps you guessing.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m no stranger to guessing. I know I was born in Philadelphia, and I know my birth mother was black. The rest has been left to my imagination, and boy, has my imagination embraced the challenge. Long after Madeline outgrew <i>Children of the World,</i> I kept playing on my own, holding up pages next to my reflection in the mirror. Picture by picture, I&#x2019;d compare the tone of my skin, the shape of my nose, lips, eyes. Is my father Irish or Italian? Am I a quarter Filipino? Part Indian or Latina or Arab? I never have an answer when people ask, &#x201c;What are you?&#x201d; I usually tell them I&#x2019;m human, but sometimes I also add that I&#x2019;m Jewish, just to make them more confused.</p><p>When Madeline and I were in third grade, and she said that Ghanaian girl looked like my twin, I started to wonder if I really might have a twin somewhere in the world. I imagined that my mother gave birth to twins, but she could only afford to keep one child, so she placed me for adoption. Unlikely, I know, and not the happiest story. But even if it were true&#x2014;that I was a twin and my birth mother kept my sister but not me&#x2014;I told myself I could handle it. I just wanted to know.</p><p>I still want to know.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why, for my bat mitzvah gift, I want to find my family. My <i>first</i> family. My blood-and-guts, double-helix, you&#x2019;re-as-stubborn-as-your-father family.</p><p>Does that sound reasonable?</p><p>My phone vibrated in my pocket, and I nearly jumped. I glanced around to make sure Mrs. Coleman was out of sight, then I took it out. A text from Madeline, who was still, like, twenty inches away. I rolled my eyes at her, but she was pretending to be very interested in Kristallnacht. (Like, too interested. She was pointing at something in the book and nodding and saying &#x201c;hmm.&#x201d;)</p><p>I opened her text. <i>Tell your parents tonight.</i></p><p>I sighed again. Maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked Madeline to make sure I do this. She wants to be an investigative reporter when she grows up&#x2014;like one of the people on NPR, this boring radio station her parents always have on in the car&#x2014;and I was starting to wonder if she was in this for me, or if she was just hoping for her first big story: <i>From NPR News in Baltimore, I&#x2019;m Madeline Winter with the latest on Imani&#x2019;s adoption story.</i></p><p>I guess I could tell her to back off, but I <i>do </i>want to investigate this too. More than anything. I just wish I could do it in a way that won&#x2019;t hurt my parents beyond repair.</p><p>Another vibration. Another text from the reporter-in-training. <i>Play the bat mitzvah card. Adult in Judaism, etc. etc.</i></p><p>This was a convincing point. When we turn thirteen and have our bat mitzvahs, we&#x2019;ll be considered adults in the Jewish religion. It doesn&#x2019;t get us much in the real world&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t be able to see R-rated movies or buy a scratch-off lotto ticket or anything&#x2014;but Mrs. Coleman and Rabbi Seider like to remind us that it does mean something symbolically. The symbolism seems extra applicable to me, since the odds that I&#x2019;m genetically Jewish are probably, like, zero. Madeline thinks I should milk that symbolism for all it&#x2019;s worth. I&#x2019;m the only black girl in Hebrew school, gamely researching a heritage that has no biological connection to me. The least my parents can do is let me research my real history too, right? If I&#x2019;m considered an adult in Judaism, I should be old enough to deal with whatever I discover.</p><p><i> Ok</i>, I texted back. <i>I will.</i> I was feeling strong and sure. I was really going to do it. That night.</p><p>I watched Madeline&#x2019;s eyes move down to the phone hidden in her book. Then she looked up at me and nodded, her freckled face lit up with satisfaction. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t run away and live with your biological family, wherever they are, okay?&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; I said. I held up Parker&#x2019;s invitation. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d miss the event of the century.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline shook her head. I thought she might bring up Ethan, who I could see cleaning his glasses with the bottom of his T-shirt, but instead she said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe her braces are Photoshopped out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Parker always looks good in pictures,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;even without Photoshop. How come I always look like I&#x2019;m about to sneeze?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look great in pictures,&#x201d; Madeline insisted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who always has, like, one eye half blinking and the other looking at the wrong camera.&#x201d;</p><p>She made a face, trying to demonstrate, and I let out a laugh so loud, the entire class&#x2014;including Ethan&#x2014;looked our way. Mrs. Coleman did not look happy. Luckily, the bell rang at that exact moment, and Madeline and I bolted before we could get in trouble. We ran, laughing and puffing, out the side door of the temple and to the corner, where we had to wait for our younger brothers so we could all walk home together.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me know what your parents say,&#x201d; Madeline said, catching her breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I promised. &#x201c;Tonight.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Thousand Splendid Suns Illustrated Edition</h2><p>This deluxe illustrated edition of<i> A Thousand Splendid Suns </i>is filled with striking and memorable photographs that bring Khaled Hosseini's compelling story to life. Since its publication in 2007, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns </i>has shipped more than three million copies. The bestselling adult novel of 2007, it spent fifteen weeks at #1 on the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list and remained on the list for an impressive forty-nine weeks. Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made <i>The Kite Runner </i>a beloved classic, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is at once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love.<br><br>Now, in this lavishly designed edition of the novel, the narrative is enhanced by expressive photos that capture the people and culture of the region in vivid detail and reflect the book's powerful themes, so apt for our times: the passionate search for family, home, acceptance, a healthy society, and a promising future-regardless of the obstacles. Together with <i>The Kite Runner: Illustrated Edition</i>, the illustrated <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns </i>creates a beautiful matched set.</p><p>It's difficult to imagine a harder first act to follow than <i>The Kite Runner</i>: a debut novel by an unknown writer about a country many readers knew little about that has gone on to have over four million copies in print worldwide. But when preview copies of Khaled Hosseini's second novel, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i>, started circulating at Amazon.com, readers reacted with a unanimous enthusiasm that few of us could remember seeing before. As special as <i>The Kite Runner</i> was, those readers said, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is more so, bringing Hosseini's compassionate storytelling and his sense of personal and national tragedy to a tale of two women that is weighted equally with despair and grave hope. <p> We wanted to spread the word on the book as widely, and as soon, as we could.

This is a brilliant writer and I look forward to more of his work." <i>Read Joanna Daneman's review</i><br><br> <b>Seth J. Frantzman</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has done it again with 'A Thousand Splendid Sons', presenting a new, dashing and dark tale of two generations of women trapped in a loveless marriage, bracketed by great events." <i>Read Seth J. Frantzman's review</i><br><br> <b>Donald Mitchell</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has succeeded in capturing many important historical and contemporary themes in a way that will make your heart ache again and again. Why will your reaction be so strong? It&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ll identify closely with the suffering of almost all the characters, a reaction that&#x2019;s very rare to a modern novel." <i>Read Donald Mitchell's review</i><br><br> <b>Lawrance M. Bernabo</b>: "All things considered, following up on a successful first novel is probably harder than coming up with the original effort and Hosseini could have rested on his laurels in the manner of Harper Lee, but as "A Thousand Splendid Suns" amply proves, this native of Kabul has more stories to tell about the land of Afghanistan." <i>Read Lawrance M. Bernabo's review</i><br><br> <b>Amanda Richards</b>: "There are parts of this book that will have grown men surreptitiously blotting the tears that are on the verge of overflowing their ducts, and by the time you get to the middle, you won&#x2019;t be able to put it down. Hosseini's simple but richly descriptive prose makes for an engrossing read, and in my opinion, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is among the best I have ever read. This is definitely not one to be missed." <i>Read Amanda Richards's review</i><br><br> <b>N. Durham</b>: "All that being said, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a bit more enjoyable than Hosseini&#x2019;s previous "The Kite Runner", and once again he manages to give we readers another glimpse of a world that we know little about but frequently condemn and discard. However, if you were one of the many that for some reason absolutely loved "The Kite Runner", chances are that you'll love this as well." <i>Read N. Durham's review</i><br><br> <b>John Kwok</b>: "Khaled Hosseini's "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a genuine instant literary classic, and one destined to be remembered as one of 2007's best novels. It should be compared favorably to such legendary Russian novels like "War and Peace" and "Doctor Zhivago"." <i>Read John Kwok's review</i><br><br> <b>Thomas Duff</b>: "Normally I'm more of an action-adventure type reader when it comes to novels and recreational reading. But I was given the chance to read A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini (author of The Kite Runner), so I decided to try something out of my normal genre. I am *so* glad I did. This is a stunning and moving novel of life and love in Afghanistan over a 30 year period." <i>Read Thomas Duff's review</i><br><br> <b>Charles Ashbacher</b>: "This book manages to simultaneously capture the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years and how women are treated in conservative Islamic societies.... In many ways it is a sad book, your heart goes out to these two women in their hopeless struggle to have a decent life with a brutal man in an unforgiving, intolerant society." <i>Read Charles Ashbacher's review</i><br><br> <b>W. Boudville</b>: "Hosseini presents a piognant view into the recent tortured decades of the Afghan experience. From the 1970s, under a king, to the Soviet takeover, to the years of resistance. And then the rise and fall of the Taliban. An American reader will recognise many of the main political events. But to many Americans, Afghanistan and its peoples and religion remain an opaque and troubling mystery." <i>Read W. Boudville's review</i><br><br> <b>Mark Baker</b>: "I tend to read plot heavy books, so this character study was a definite change of pace for me. I found the first half slow going at times, mainly because I knew where the story was going. Once I got into the second half, things really picked up. The ending was very bittersweet. I couldn't think of a better way to end it." <i>Read Mark Baker's review</i><br><br> <b>Grady Harp</b>: "Hosseini takes us behind those walls for forty some years of Afghanistan's bloody history and while he does not spare us any of the descriptions of the terror that continues to besiege that country, he does offer us a story that speaks so tenderly about the fragile beauty of love and devotion and lasting impression people make on people." <i>Read Grady Harp's review</i><br><br> <b>Robert P. Beveridge</b>: "When I was actively reading it, the pages kept turning, and more than once I found myself foregoing food or sleep temporarily to get in just one more chapter. When I had put it down, however, I felt no particular compulsion to pick it back up again. It's a good book, and a relatively well-written one, but it's not a great book. Enjoyable without leaving a lasting impression." <i>Read Robert P. Beveridge's review</i><br><br> <b>B. Marold</b>: "While the events in Afghanistan and the wider world create a familiar framework for the stories of these two women, it is nothing more than a framework. The warp and weft of everyday life, and the interaction of the two women and their close relatives is the heartbeat of the story." <i>Read B. Marold's review</i><br><br> <b>Daniel Jolley</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has written a majestic, sweeping, emotionally powerful story that provides the reader with a most telling window into Afghan society over the past thirty-odd years. It's also a moving story of friendship and sacrifice, giving Western readers a rare glimpse into the suffering and mistreatment of Afghan women that began long before the Taliban came to power." <i>Read Daniel Jolley's review</i><br><br> </p>Khaled Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and moved to the United States in 1980.

E.) reexamines events following the abdication of Oedipus, focusing on the civil war between the brothers Eteocles, King of Thebes, and Polynices, who comes at the head of an army from Argos to claim his share of royal power. The poem is long&#x2015;each of the twelve books comprises over eight hundred lines&#x2015;and complex, and it exploits a broad range of literary works, both Greek and Latin. Severely curtailed though he was by the emperor Domitian and his Reign of Terror, Statius nevertheless created a meditation on autocratic rule that is still of political interest today. Popular in its own time and much admired in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance&#x2015;most notably by Dante and Chaucer&#x2015;the poem fell into obscurity and has, for readers of English, been poorly served by translators.</p><p>Statius composed his poem in dactylic hexameters, the supreme verse form in antiquity. In his hands, this venerable line is flexible, capable of subtle emphases and dramatic shifts in tempo; it is an expressive, responsive medium. In this new and long-awaited translation the poet Jane Wilson Joyce employs a loose, six-beat line in her English translation, which allows her to reveal something of the original rhythm and of the interplay between sentence structure and verse framework. The clarity of Joyce's translation highlights the poem's superb versification, sophisticated use of intertextuality, and bold formal experimentation and innovation. A substantial introduction and annotations make this epic accessible to students of all levels.</p></p><p>"Jane Wilson Joyce's translation of the Thebaid is a stunning achievement. The long lines of loosely flowing rhythms represent Statius' manner more accurately and vividly (and in more accomplished verse) than any translation of the poem I have seen. The result is a sophisticated and very challenging poem, striking and even austere in some ways, hardly modern yet less old fashioned than other fashioned, and in its way quite new."-William Levitan, Grand Valley State University <p>"Our generation has developed such an appetite for violence and horror that it is more than ready to appreciate Statius' Thebaid. Thanks to Jane Wilson Joyce, a poet in her own right, we now have a rich and vivid translation that matches the pace and urgency of Statius' narrative: his gods are vindictive, his demons gruesome, his champions brutal, while brave and innocent young warriors meet their deaths and loving women grieve for them. Statius' imaginative power and Joyce's language set before us in passionate variety scenes of human hatred and loyalty, arrogance and exaltation, supernatural omens, ghosts and furies, and a fratricidal climax that drives the gods from the battlefield in sheer disgust. <br><br> How lucky for readers that Jane Wilson Joyce is also a scholar! She has doubled the value of her work by supplying everything the reader needs to follow the heroic tale, a substantial introduction on Statius' life and times, synopses to open each book, footnotes, and a lively critical commentary."-- Elaine Fantham, Giger Professor of Latin Emerita, Princeton University</p><p>Jane Wilson Joyce is Luellen Professor of Literature (Classics) at Centre College. She is the translator of Lucan's Pharsalia, also from Cornell.</p></p><h2>Kane Chronicles, The, Book Three: Serpent&#39;s Shadow: The Graphic Novel, The-Kane Chronicles, The, Book Three</h2><p>He's b-a-a-ack! Despite their best efforts, Carter and Sadie Kane can't seem to keep Apophis, the chaos snake, down. Now Apophis is threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness, and the Kanes are faced with the impossible task of having to destroy him once and for all. Unfortunately, the magicians of the House of Life are on the brink of civil war, the gods are divided, and the young initiates of Brooklyn House stand almost alone against the forces of chaos. The Kanes' only hope is an ancient spell that might turn the serpent's own shadow into a weapon, but the magic has been lost for a millennia. To find the answer they need, the Kanes must rely on the murderous ghost of a powerful magician who might be able to lead them to the serpent's shadow . . . or might lead them to their deaths in the depths of the underworld.

Free's Archaeology and Bible History, first published in 1950, served well an entire generation of pastors, Sunday school teachers, laypersons, and college students by summarizing the history of the Bible and shedding light on biblical events through archaeological discoveries. The author demonstrated how such data helps us understand the Bible and confirm its historical accuracy. At times he also dealt with issues of biblical interpretation and criticism, always from a historically orthodox position. When the book was withdrawn from circulation in 1976 after the fourteenth printing, many hoped for the day when it would be revised and updated. That task has now been undertaken by one of Dr. Free's former students and a biblical archaeologist in his own right, Dr. Howard Vos. He has brought the archaeological and historical material up to date and has modified earlier archaeological interpretations where necessary. The bibliography has been almost totally replaced.</p></p><p>The late Joseph P. Free was chairman of the department of archaeology at Wheaton College, and later, professor of archaeology and history at Bemidji State College in Minnesota. He did extensive excavations of the city of Dothan and published numerous articles on issues of archaeology.<br><br>Howard F. Vos has had a distinguished career as an expert in historical, geographical, biblical, and archeological research. A prolific author and editor, he is responsible for twenty-five books that are standards in their field, including the Wycliffe Bible Dictionary. He has traveled extensively in the Bible lands and excavated many sites in Israel. Vos is currently Emeritus Professor of History and Archaeology at The King's College in New York.</p><h2>Men and Gods: MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>This outstanding collection brings together the novelist and scholar Rex Warner&#x2019;s knack for spellbinding storytelling with Edward Gorey&#x2019;s inimitable talent as an illustrator in a memorable modern recounting of the most beloved myths of ancient Greece. <br><br>Writing in a relaxed and winning colloquial style, Warner vividly recreates the classic stories of Jason and the Argonauts and Theseus and the Minotaur, among many others, while Gorey&#x2019;s quirky pen-and-ink sketches offer a visual interpretation of these great myths in the understated but brilliantly suggestive style that has gained him admirers throughout the world. These tales cover the range of Greek mythology, including the creation story of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the heroic adventures of Perseus, the fall of Icarus, Cupid and Psyche&#x2019;s tale of love, and the tragic history of Oedipus and Thebes.<i> Men and Gods</i> is an essential and delightful book with which to discover some of the key stories of world literature.</p><p><p><b>Rex Warner</b> (1905&#x2014;1986) was an author, translator, and professor of English.

His business is to hunt for names on paper, collect them, sell them, and occasionally fake them&#x2014;all to give the people what they want: a little piece of Fame. But what does Alex want? Only the return of his father, the end of religion, something for his headache, three different girls, infinite grace, and the rare autograph of forties movie actress Kitty Alexander. With fries.<br><br> <b>The Autograph Man</b> is a deeply funny existential tour around the hollow trappings of modernity: celebrity, cinema, and the ugly triumph of symbol over experience. It offers further proof that Zadie Smith is one of the most staggeringly talented writers of her generation.&nbsp;Look for her new book <i>Swing Time</i>, coming November 2016.<i><br> </i></p><p>When Alex-Li Tandem is 12 years old, his father takes him and his friends Adam and Rubinfine to a wrestling match at the Albert Hall in London. By the end of the evening, the pivotal events of Alex-Li's youth have occurred: he has met Joseph Klein, a boy whose fascination with autographs proves infectious; his friendships with Adam and Rubinfine are cemented; and his father has dropped dead. This is enough action for an entire book, and in fact things slow down dramatically after page 35 of Zadie Smith's sophomore novel <i>The Autograph Man</i>. When we meet Alex again, he is a grown man, an autograph dealer and devoted slacker, suffering the physical and spiritual after-effects of a three-day romance with a drug called "Superstar." While under its malign influence, Alex has managed to wreck his sports car, alienate his girlfriend Esther, and--possibly--forge the rare autograph of his idol, the 1950s movie star Kitty Alexander. Will his friends save him from the embarrassment of trying to sell this suspect autograph? Will they pull him together in time to perform Kaddish on the 15th anniversary of his father's death? Although not as enthralling or politically resonant as <i>White Teeth</i>, Smith's hallowed debut, <i>The Autograph Man</i> amply demonstrates her ability to juggle several main characters, several themes, and a host of plots and subplots, with the occasional purely comic episode thrown up in the air beside them like a chainsaw or a cheesecake.

After all, how many chefs, cooks and gastronomes know that the&nbsp;best dim sum experience is to be had in Hong Kong?&nbsp;Or that the only place&nbsp;to try&nbsp;the classic dish sweet and sour pork is&nbsp;in a snake restaurant?&nbsp; Or that one of the best contemporary Western meals in the world is to be enjoyed in Hong Kong, a country situated in the East?<br><br> In <i>Hong Kong Food City</i>, Tony imparts his incredible knowledge of the dynamic cultural landscape of a city whose Chinese roots are also intertwined with deep colonial connections back to England. Equally at home with some of the best dim sum in the world and English high tea, Hong Kong-ers are a sophisticated lot. As such, Hong Kong&#x2019;s food scene is not only exciting but it's one of the only places in the world where you can enjoy true Michelin star food at an affordable price.&nbsp;<br><br> The first book to look at the Hong Kong food scene from all perspectives, <i>Hong Kong Food City</i> is a comprehensive book that not only contains approachable authentic recipes but provides the background to the eclectic food scene via an explanation of history, culture, cooking styles and social norms. Its 80 recipes are inspired by the island&#x2019;s dishes, from the Peninsula Hotel and the stalls of the night markets, to the high-end restaurants of the Grand Mandarin Oriental and a legendary dumpling house on the edge of Kowloon. With chapters including starters, soups and cold dishes, dim sum and seafood, Tony Tan&#x2019;s recipes range from the classic sweet and sour soup and seaweed salad with sakura shrimp to bang bang chicken and the delicious Korean spicy pork wraps. By outlining the basic pantry necessary for cooking his recipes and using flavours from across Hong Kong, Tan takes the reader on a culinary adventure that will educate their palate and give them the skills to create Chinese food at home.&nbsp;<br><br> Part food immersion, part travel experience, <i>Hong Kong Food City</i> extends beyond the recipes as it offers stories of chopstick etiquette and tea houses, and explains how Hong Kong became the city it is today. In combination with the stunning shots of the city&#x2019;s streets, galleries, restaurants and famous light show, these stories create a window into the culinary culture of Hong Kong making it accessible and enticing to all.&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Tony Tan</b> was born on the east coast of Malaysia into a restaurant-owning family.

He is the 2017 international judge at Hong Kong&#x2019;s cuisine challenge, The Best of the Best Culinary Competition, and his cookery school was ranked 22 best in the world by<i> Financial Times London</i>.</p>"Photos of everyday life, essays on the Chinese approach to cooking (Chinese cooks were using every part of the animal before &#x201c;nose to tail&#x201d; became fashionable, he notes), instructions on making stock, and a crash course in dim sum are just some of the many reasons the book will resonate with armchair travelers and fans of Asian cuisine."<b><i> - Publisher's Weekly</i></b></p><h2>Homiletic: Moves and Structures</h2><p>Buttrick presents a complete homiletic that focuses on how sermons form in consciousness and how the language of preaching functions in the communal consciousness of a congregation.

The book helped homeowners to attain this goal through its presentation of full-color illustrations of attractive, up-to-date color schemes for houses, with special attention given to the refined lines of Queen Anne-style homes.<br>The heart of the book is the section of 20 exquisite color plates &#x2014; each reproducing a flawlessly executed architectural drawing that shows the color possibilities for a specific house, and each accompanied by an extensive written description of the colors to be used for exterior walls and trim. An informative introductory section gives a clear explanation of how to mix primary and secondary colors to achieve such popular, mellow tones of the period as olive, russet, citrine, buff, plum, and sage. This authentic source of inspiration and suggestions will be prized by restorationists, architects, home-builders, and lovers of Victoriana.<br></p><p></p><h2>Leopard at the Door</h2><p><b>Set in Kenya in the 1950s against the fading backdrop of the British Empire, a story of self-discovery, betrayal, and an impossible love from the author of <i>The Fever Tree</i>.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> After six years in England, Rachel has returned to Kenya and the farm where she spent her childhood, but the beloved home she&#x2019;d longed for is much changed.

The steward has said we will dock at 9am, but I am too excited to sleep, and I walk onto deck in the dark, long before the sun comes up, watching for the first sight of land. I pull a packet of cigarettes from my coat pocket, light one and inhale, smoke curling up into the warm night sky. My heart beats out a rhythm born of long anticipation. After six years I am finally coming home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lamp casts a small pool of light onto a black metal bench. Someone has left a book behind, and I pick it up. <i>The Settler&#x2019;s Guide to Up-Country Swahili: Exercises for the Soldier, Settler, Miner, Merchant and their Wives</i>.&nbsp; I open it and cast my eye over the introduction. <i>This book aims at teaching, in a simple way, just that degree of Swahili that is understood and talked by the average intelligent up-country native.</i> A curious use of adjectives, not something you would find in England. It is a long time since I have used my Swahili and I wonder how much will come back to me. The book starts with greetings, and I turn the phrases over silently on my tongue, enjoying the familiar rhythm of the words <i>Jambo Bwana. Jambo Memsaab. Habari Gani hapa? Habari mzuri tu, Bwana</i>. What&#x2019;s the news here? <i>Only good news, Bwana</i>. I slip the book into my pocket, unconsciously reciting the phrases as I stare out into the dark, waiting for our arrival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An hour later the sun rises huge and heavy from the horizon. Through a screen of mist I make out the shadow of Mombasa island. A couple wander onto deck, clutching cups of coffee and bread rolls, whispering excitedly. My eyes are fixed on what lies ahead. Green coconut palms and a scattering of white buildings emerge out of water so blue that I realise I have forgotten the meaning of colour. The sky is clear and limitless. In England &#x2013; a country in the grip of rationing, where the sun struggles to illuminate even the clearest winter day - no one has understood my descriptions of the sky in Kenya. My skin burns in the early morning sun, my neck damp beneath the weight of my hair. The white sails of the Arab dhows soar like the wings of huge, prehistoric birds, their decks crammed so full of Africans, grinning and shouting, clinging to every mast, that sinking seems an inevitability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They shout up their greetings in Swahili. <i>Karibu</i>. Welcome. And I grin down at them, waving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We dock, and I step giddily down the gangplank into a city that smells of fish, of salt, of acrid wood smoke and sewage &#x2013; the smell of a city whose people live life outdoors under a hot sun - down into the sweltering heat of the customs sheds where I am left waiting, sweating for a few hours before being released onto the small, crowded streets of Mombasa&#x2019;s port.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bougainvillea tumble over white walls, purple, orange, crimson red, amidst the trumpets of white datura flowers and clusters of pink hibiscus. Dhow captains spread their intricately woven carpets on the street for sale, beating out the dust in thick clouds. Porters in bare feet and white lunghis pad across the hot cobbles between piles of old newspaper and fish bones, past the Arab men dressed in white robes, who sit on low wooden stools drinking tea. I can smell roasting fish rising from a charcoal fire tended by two sailors in brightly coloured kikoys, who stand prodding the coals, spitting out jets of red betel nut into the street, while others unload their cargo &#x2013; boxes of fish, dates, henna, great piles of copper wire. Indian women in saris gossip in close groups. I stand and watch, dazzled by so much noise and colour, happiness soaring inside me. I have escaped England. I am back in Africa. But I am not home yet. There are still four hundred miles to travel, up country, before I see the farm, before I see my father.</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Aleela</i>,&#x201d; a voice says behind me, and a hand touches me on the shoulder. <i>Aleela &#x2013; she cries</i> in <i>Swahili</i>. It was the name the Africans had given me as a baby, when I was born healthy, after my mother had given birth to a child who never breathed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turn and see Kahiki, our headman, standing there, his stick in one hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Jambo</i> I say, smiling as hard as I have ever smiled in my life.</p><p><i>Jambo Sana </i>he answers, his eyes smiling back at me, grasping my outstretched hand in his sinewy one. And &#x2013; just like that &#x2013; I have come home.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>II</b></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We come out onto the main road, into a cacophony of beeping and shouting. There has been an accident. A truck carrying pigs has turned over in the middle of the road and the traffic is at a standstill. A crowd of Africans gather round, watching. Tight rolls of pig flesh squeeze out of the slatted sides, their squeals sharpening the gloopy midday heat. <i>Downers</i> my uncle used to call them; pigs which were all cut up. He owns Uplands &#x2013; the bacon factory which supplies Kenya&#x2019;s Europeans and safari outfits with the sausages, hams and pork pies that remind them of home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We nudge our way past, the pigs grunting as they struggle to find a footing on the small slither of space which forms the side panel of the truck. Those who do find a foothold on the floor, are being crushed under the weight of those on top. The truck emits a dark, dense heat, palpable with the wet stench of their panic, and the dry chafing of their bristles. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They must have been on their way to the train which would take them to the factory. They&#x2019;ll be loaded anyway, once they get the truck back on the road; and finished off when they get there. I look away, struggling to suppress the memories which are threatening to take shape inside me. I have forgotten this other side of Kenya: a raw physicality that has no shame in the inevitability of pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The jeep is parked just beyond the truck. &nbsp;Kahiki throws my luggage into the back and I see a man of about my father&#x2019;s age, with a closely cut blond beard, and a dark, suntanned face, making his way through the crowd towards us. He is wearing tattered khaki shorts and desert boots, and he holds a black camera in one hand. He is broad and tall, and moves easily, though his face is creased with sun and age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Rachel?&#x201d; He holds out a large hand, and grasps mine in his. &#x201c;Nathaniel Logan. Good to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I say, unsure why he is here. His voice has the mellow, slow drawl of an American. He is a curious mix of down at heel, and well kitted out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He gets into the driver&#x2019;s seat, and I realise, with a swallow of disappointment, what I hadn&#x2019;t trusted myself to ask Kahiki &#x2013; that my father has not come to meet me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nathanial Logan leans over and opens the passenger door with one hand, &#x201c;Your father asked me to pick you up. He&#x2019;s stuck at the farm. They&#x2019;ve had some trouble with the harvest.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stows his camera in a box, then glances up at me, standing in the street. &#x201c;Hey kiddo, it&#x2019;s not so bad. I won&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I swing myself up into the passenger seat. Kahiki is in the back. The American starts the engine, and hands me a bunch of bananas, toy size and sunflower yellow. I tear one off the bunch, peel it and bite into an almost impossible sweetness - after three weeks of tinned food on the ship, the sensation of something so sun soaked and sweet makes me catch my breath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The truck turned over an hour ago.&#x201d; Nathanial pulls the car out into the road, his hand on the horn, the crowd parting to let us through. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they let the pigs out?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want even more of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once we have manoeuvred onto the clear road, he looks at me and smiles. &#x201c;First time back in a long while?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Six years.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you missed it like hell.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smile back at him. He has just about summed it up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The white houses of Mombasa give way to lush vegetation, banana palms and fruit trees. He must sense the question in my silence, because he says, &#x201c;I was coming as far as Nairobi anyway. I needed to buy some gear.&#x201d; He gestures at the back of the Land Rover and I see a tarpaulin strapped over the boot. &#x201c;Trying to keep the dust out. Damn stuff corrodes the kit.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know my father?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been staying at Matebele for the last couple of months.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;With the Markhams?&#x201d; Matebele was a farm about an hour&#x2019;s drive from Kisima. Lillian Markham had been my mother&#x2019;s closest friend, and we had written to each other over the last six years. &#x201c;What are you doing up there?&#x201d; Our corner of Kenya was out of the way, and we rarely had visitors who weren&#x2019;t farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working for the American Museum of Natural History. Trying to track white rhino. I&#x2019;ve found some good specimens up in Laikipia, near the Markham&#x2019;s farm.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;To hunt?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;To photograph. This man &#x2013; &#x201d; He turns in his seat and grins at Kahiki, &#x201c; &#x2013;found them for me. One of the best trackers I&#x2019;ve ever met.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kahiki nods at Nathaniel, which is as close as he comes to smiling. He is Dorobo. He is small and strong, and made of muscle. He has quick eyes and clever hands. He carved wooden toys for me as a child, his knife shaping the wood into a lioness or baboon that was so real it was as though his hands had coaxed it into life. He knew the land better than anyone else on the farm &#x2013; he could track any bird or animal. He could find the claw marks of a leopard on a yellow barked acacia, and tell you how long before he had climbed down, and when he had last made a kill. He hunted with a bow and arrow, and I used to love watching the flick of the thin arrow floating high up into the air, its soft flight belying the deadly accuracy of its aim. It was Kahiki who set the trap for a lioness who was raiding my father&#x2019;s cattle; who found an elephant tusk buried deep in the earth which weighed nearly ninety pounds, the largest ever recorded on our land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You used to take me into the forest, and call for the honey guide bird &#x2013; do you remember?&#x201d; I ask Kahiki in Swahili.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Aleela. And you would not eat the honey in the forest for fear that the bees would come back for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laugh &#x2013; remembering. &#x201c;The honey guide would lead us to a hive nesting in the branches of a tree and Kahiki would rub sticks into fire, and smoke out the bees. When we had collected what we wanted we used to leave the comb for the honey guide &#x2013; &#x201d; I turn to Kahiki &#x2013; &#x201c;&#x2013; You always said that the bird would next time lead us to a mamba if we did not.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And it is true.&#x201d; He replies, his yellowing brown eyes soft on mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Kahiki used to walk with my mother.&#x201d; I say, feeling a sliver of pain in remembering, but pleasure too in sharing this, like the turning of a tooth. I can see the sitting room where she worked at Kisima, the long shelf crammed full of strange objects gathered from the land. And the early morning walks along the narrow tracks that spun like spider&#x2019;s webs through the dense bush, Kahiki in front, his bow in one hand, my mother&#x2019;s footsteps just behind my own. &#x201c;She used to collect things.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of things?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fossils, bones, bits of stone.

With simple, direct prose, he makes clear how "our eyes and ears sense light and sound and send nerve signals to the brain." Then he shows how the brain puts the information together. The large, exquisitely reproduced photographs from a number of sources look like fiery planets, galaxies, and monster creatures, and they may be more dazzling than explanatory, but they bring the science up close with pictures of everything from an eyeball to the cone cells on a retina to the thin flap of skin that is the eardrum. The anatomy and physiology are detailed and accurate, with clear diagrams that show the human body and how it works. Whether Simon talks about the reason for nearsightedness or how the ears' semicircular canals affect balance, he has a rare ability to explain the facts and the wonder of them without being condescending or cute. He also offers a few interactive pages, including entertaining examples of optical illusions and instructions for checking the blind spot on the retina. This will also interest high-school students and adults. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Paden puts forth the idea that our understanding of religion influences our understanding of ourselves and our world. Updated with a new introduction, this book is for anyone who wants to consider and discuss religious beliefs.</p><p>William Paden is professor and chair of the department of religion at the University of Vermont.Paden ( Religious Words , LJ 12/88) examines how social anthropologists, depth psychologists, comparative religionists, and religious people (especially Christians) interpret religion. An individual's interpretation is influenced by his or her worldview, audience, and object under analysis (e.g., ritual). By being aware of different interpretations, one's own is supplemented without being supplanted--this is an advantage of religious pluralism's "relativity." Paden does not share his faith, despite the claim that if he did readers would better understand his views. This scholarly work is clearly written yet assumes some prior study of religion. This is one of a few excellent books about the subject. Recommended for academic and large public libraries.<br><i>- Steven A. Fondiller, St. John's Univ.

She builds them short, clean, and straightforward. This consistency gives her the ability to drop an extremely intense image or profound line out of nowhere, create convincing cliff-hangers, or slowly increase the stakes of a scene until you feel like a frog in suddenly boiling water. <b>But the great achievement of the novel is the way Fu renders her characters.

Fortunately, our eagle-eyed voyeur emerges from her narrative forays unscathed and ready to take on the kinks, obsessions, and messiness of our lives. <i>Sexographies</i> is an eye-opening, kamikaze journey across the contours of the human body and mind.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b><br> <br> <b>Gabriela Wiener</b> (Lima, 1975) is author of the&nbsp;<i>cr�nicas</i>&nbsp;collections&nbsp;<i>Sexograf�as,</i>&nbsp;<i>Nueve Lunas,</i>&nbsp;<i>Mozart, la iguana con priapismo y otras historias</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Llamada perdida.</i>&nbsp;Her work also includes the poetry collection&nbsp;<i>Ejercicios para el endurecimiento del esp�ritu</i>.

Constantly testing the limits of genre and gender, Wiener�s work as a cronista (which roughly translates, but is by no means a direct synonym, of nonfiction writer) has bravely unveiled truths some may prefer remain concealed about a range of topics, from the daily life of polymorphous desire to the tiring labor of maternity.&#x201d; Author: Cristina Rivera Garza, author of The Iliac Crest<br><br>&#x201c;This collection of essays [opens] on the outskirts of Lima, jumps to a swinger&#x2019;s party in Barcelona, and next a squirt expert&#x2019;s apartment. This book can feel psychologically hazardous to read; it pushes you to answer the questions Wiener asks herself: <i>Would I? Could I? Will I?</i>&#x201d; Author: Angela Ledgerwood Source: Esquire, Best Books of 2018<br><br><b>&#x201c;</b>In her native Peru, Gabriela Wiener has a reputation as a gonzo journalist who takes an active role in whatever subject she investigates, which as often as not involves sex, and not the vanilla variety. In this collection, her first translated into English, we meet a notorious polygamous pornographer; go to 6&amp;9, a Barcelona sex club; interview the cruel Lady Monique de Nemours, a world-class dominatrix; visit Vanessa, a member of the European community of Latin American trans sex workers; get a first-hand look at the perils of threesomes; and explore other topics a tad too risqu� to even name in a family newspaper. Suffice to say, Wiener&#x2019;s free-wheeling style is hugely entertaining.&#x201d; Author: Sarah Murdoch Source: Toronto Star<br><br>&#x201c;These are essays of unabashed honesty and uncommon freedom of mind, bravely reported and beautifully composed. I hadn&#x2019;t known how hungry I&#x2019;d been for this book, how I&#x2019;d needed it and wanted other books to be it. <i>Sexographies</i> is an antidote and a revelation, and Gabriela Wiener is a brilliant documenter of sex and life as they really are." Author: Kristin Dombek, author of The Selfishness of Others<br><br>"Reading Gabriela Wiener is a joy. Over the years, her work has made me cry, laugh, hurt, and most importantly, dream. Her essays are daring, intimate, and honest, containing the self-awareness of a poet and the sharp focus of a marksman. I'd follow her anywhere." Author: Daniel Alarc�n, author of At Night We Walk in Circles<br><br>&#x201c;One of the most interesting writers of this generation is Gabriela Wiener, a Peruvian journalist best known for her high-spirited explorations of female sexuality.... Wiener is witty and fast-paced; many of her experiences, sexual and otherwise, are hard-won, territories explored and sometimes conquered, despite her neurotic misgivings, with courage and aplomb. Part of her appeal lies in the fact that she sometimes writes about sexual topics that have not been well explored, especially by women, and a sense of incredulity is part of the pleasure of reading her work. &#x2018;Is she really going to do that?&#x2019; the reader wonders. &#x2018;Is she really going to write (and so openly) about doing that?&#x2019; And then she does, and there&#x2019;s a slight but perceptible shift in the world because she did.&#x201d; Author: Lisa Fetchko Source: Los Angeles Review of Books<br><br>&#x201c;With sizzling prose and journalistic attentiveness, Wiener honors the no-clothes rule. She exposes her readers to not only her body, but also to the neuroses, fears, and fantasies that come with it. True to the first-person style of gonzo journalism, each of Wiener&#x2019;s fifteen transgressive cr�nicas pull readers into penetrative commentaries on infidelity, abortion, and threesomes, not to mention the ever-elusory &#x2018;Ninja Squirt.&#x2019;... <i>Sexographies</i> strikes the delicate balance between carnal and curious.... It [expands] the meaning of what pleasure in life can be, sexual or otherwise." Author: Madeline Day Source: The Paris Review<br><br>&#x201c;This is a first-person account of the author&#x2019;s experience infiltrating a dangerous Peruvian prison, participating in swingers clubs, traveling through Paris with prostitutes, and going through a harrowing egg-donation process. Chock-full of robust human experiences, the heroine of this essay collection explores a diverse set of themes like immigration, maternity, fear of death, ugliness, and sexuality with an engaging forthrightness." Author: Claire Riggs Source: World Literature Today<br><br>&#x201c;The most striking quality of Sexographies is Gabriela Wiener&#x2019;s fearlessness&#x2014;her ability to broach any topic without the slightest flinch, however unfamiliar or achingly personal.... Wiener&#x2019;s essays do not deal solely in sex, as the title of the collection may suggest, but in the exploration of identity and gender. How are we to make sense of our own bodies and the bodies of others? Why is it that we&#x2014;with the internet at our fingertips&#x2014;supposedly know more than ever, yet often experience less and are less open to the experiences of others? Wiener urges us to ask these questions in order to uncover the artificial boundaries that have confined us to our own experiences. With a voice as unapologetic as it is searching, this gonzo journalist delivers her findings on a wide variety of topics, from egg donation to prison tattoos to BDSM. Nothing is off limits to Gabriela Wiener and she spares her readers no detail of her adventures. The result is Sexographies&#x2014;an addictive and darkly funny collection that surprises at every turn.&#x201d; Source: The Arkansas International<br><br>&#x201c;Reading her, one has the feeling of an unexpected closeness, able to go at the speed of heart rate. Gabriela Wiener doesn&#x2019;t seem to have any taboos or issues in revealing to us her own sexuality, her own suffering, her curiosity or her morbid fascination, and this sincerity makes her prose admirable, a bravery not so common in our times.&#x201d; Author: Guadalupe Nettel Source: Letras Libres</p><h2>Yesterday&#39;s Tomorrow: Raw Stories of Hard-Fought Recovery</h2><p><b>This meditation book shows why and, more importantly, how recovery works written in no-nonsense language by a "hard case" who's been there -- and been there, and been there.</b><br><br>Barry L. has been clean and sober for more than 14 years, but there was a time when his multiple trips through relapse, detox, and treatment made sobriety seem an impossibility.

Saved in his early twenties, he soon felt called of God to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who had never heard the good news of salvation. Twice he applied to the Sudan Interior Mission, and twice he was refused. He told the director, Rowland Bingham, that he was going to Africa anyway. Upon being asked what board he was going under, Tommie replied, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Mr. Bingham. It may be some old woman&#x2019;s wash board, but I&#x2019;m going to Africa!&#x201d; Seeing Tommie&#x2019;s determination, Mr. Bingham soon afterwards relented and accepted him into SIM and he became the first missionary to live among the Yagba people of Nigeria, West Africa. His story is a blood-stirring pioneer thriller. More than that, it is the record of how God used a very ordinary man to break into an animistic society and start a movement that produced a large and healthy church. Tommie Titcombe&#x2019;s spiritual insights and personal courage have made his name a legend among the many Christians of Yagbaland. His story also provides us with an extremely relevant case history of sound missionary principles at work.</p><p></p><h2>Cherokee Reference Grammar</h2><p>The Cherokees have the oldest and best-known Native American writing system in the United States. Invented by Sequoyah and made public in 1821, it was rapidly adopted, leading to nineteenth-century Cherokee literacy rates as high as 90 percent. This writing system, the Cherokee syllabary, is fully explained and used throughout this volume, the first and only complete published grammar of the Cherokee language.<br><br> Although the <i>Cherokee Reference Grammar </i>focuses on the dialect spoken by the Cherokees in Oklahoma&#x2014;the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians&#x2014;it provides the grammatical foundation upon which all the dialects are based. In his introduction, author Brad Montgomery-Anderson offers a brief account of Cherokee history and language revitalization initiatives, as well as instructions for using this grammar. The book then delves into an explanation of Cherokee pronunciation, orthography, parts of speech, and syntax.<br><br> While the book is intended as a reference grammar for experienced scholars, Montgomery-Anderson presents the information in accessible stages, moving from easier examples to more complex linguistic structures. Examples are taken from a variety of sources, including many from the <i>Cherokee Phoenix</i>. Audio clips of various text examples throughout can be found on the accompanying CDs. The volume also includes three appendices: a glossary keyed to the text; a typescript for the audio component; and a collection of literary texts: two traditional stories and a historical account of a search party traveling up the Arkansas River.<br><br> The Cherokee Nation, as the second-largest tribe in the United States and the largest in Oklahoma, along with the United Keetoowah Band and the Eastern band of Cherokees, have a large number of people who speak their native language. Like other tribes, they have seen a sharp decline in the number of native speakers, particularly among the young, but they have responded with ambitious programs for preserving and revitalizing Cherokee culture and language. <i>Cherokee Reference Grammar</i> will serve as a vital resource in advancing these efforts to understand Cherokee history, language, and culture on their own terms.</p><p><b>Brad Montgomery-Anderson</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Cherokee and Indigenous Studies at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

From the French and American revolutions to the post-Soviet, ethnic, and terrorist movements of today, contentious politics exercises a fleeting but powerful influence on politics, society, and international relations. This study surveys the modern history of the modern social movements in the West and their diffusion to the global South through war, colonialism, and diffusion, and it puts forward a theory to explain its cyclical surges and declines. It offers an interpretation of the power of movements that emphasizes effects on the lives of militants, policy reforms, political institutions, and cultural change. The book focuses on the rise and fall of social movements as part of contentious politics in general and as the outcome of changes in political opportunities and constraints, state strategy, the new media of communication, and transnational diffusion.</p><p>This book offers an interpretation of the power of social movements that emphasizes their effects on the lives of militants, policy reforms, political institutions, and cultural change.

It is an anomalous propulsion force from a high voltage capacitive charge, similar to an electrokinetic force. In the 1950s, T. Townsend Brown recommended a &#34;flying wing&#34; model to the Naval Research Lab for its implementation and years later, the B-2 bomber fulfilled this vision. Electrogravitics Systems includes historical documents, patents, and an exciting article by Dr. Paul LaViolette on how the B-2 uses such an energy-efficient, futuristic propulsion concept today.</p><p>Thomas Valone has a Master&#39;s degree in physics and is a retired college teacher. He is also an electrical engineer, licensed professional engineer and a former U.S. patent examiner. Author of numerous articles and two books, he lectures often at popular scientific conferences representing Integrity Research Institute with energy and propulsion research findings.Having made a theoretical case for electrogravitics, the book also makes an historical one. Hints of electrogravitics in the history of aviation, revealed through the developments and statements made by major aircraft industries in articles from the Aviation Report in the mid-1950s, are reprinted. T.T. Brown's work is described in detail. The paper by Paul LaViolette was an intriguing speculation that the B-2 stealth bomber operates on T.T. Brown's principle of propulsion. Statements from government and ex-government workers and officials were shown to fit nicely with this possibility...This book can be appreciated by anyone who is interested in electrogravitics. -- <i>Leslee Kulba, Electric Spacecraft Journal, Issue 12, 1994, p. 37</i><br><br>In the early 1920's Dr. Paul A. Biefield, a physicist and adquaintance of Albert Einstein, working at the California Institute for Advanced Studies, discovered that a highly charged capacitor has an anomalous tendency to move in the direction of its positive pole. Biefield assigned Thomas Townsend Brown, his prodigy, to study the phenomena as a research project. That the effect is not due to ion wind is borne out in claims that the effect exists under insulating oil and high vacuum...T.T. Brown devoted considerable effort, time, and means to researching this effect. Although his work has been sensationalized, it also has attracted professional attention. "Electrogravitics Systems: Reports on a New Propulsion Methodology" edited by physicist Thomas Valone, MA, PE, is a currect and cogent anthology of reports on the electrogravitic research of T.T. Brown. -- <i>Vincent Coon, New Energy News, Vol. 2, No. 5, Sept., 1994, p. 10</i><br><br>Many readers may recall the name of T. Townsend Brown as it was historically associated with UFOs. Brown was the first director of the now-defunct, but once very active, National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), a Washington, DC-based lobby group that was very instrumental in the 1960s for getting congressional leaders interested in the UFO mystery. But what the majority may not realize was that Brown was also a very highly acclaimed physicist who held many patents and worked on a variety of highly classified projects...In fact, in the recently published report titled, Electrogravitics Systems--Reports on a New Propulsion Methodology, Valone sees a very strong tie between Brown's discoveries and the development of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. -- <i>UFO Sightings, Summer 1995, p. 17</i></p><h2>Pericles (Webster&#39;s Malay Thesaurus Edition)</h2><p>Webster's paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

Jonson's praise is especially prescient, since at the turn of the 17th century Shakespeare was but one of many popular London playwrights and none of his dramas were printed in his lifetime. The reason so many of his works survive is because two of his actor friends, with the assistance of Jonson, assembled and published the First Folio edition of 1623.</p></p><h2>Talk About Understanding: Rethinking Classroom Talk to Enhance Comprehension</h2><p><p>Reading education<strong> </strong>pioneer<strong> Ellin Oliver Keene</strong> demystifies comprehension instruction by describing <em>what it can</em> <em>look like</em> when readers comprehend deeply and <em>what it can</em> <em>look like</em> when teachers aim for this deep comprehension.

Engaging and accessible, it covers all the main arguments for and against God's existence, from traditional philosophical "proofs" to arguments that involve the latest developments in biology and physics. Three main characters represent the principal views: Theodore Logan, the theist; Eva Lucien, the atheist; and Gene Sesquois, the agnostic. Their debate takes place during a post-college cross-country road trip during which Gene expresses dismay over his future. He wants to do something meaningful with his life but is at a loss as to how to proceed, despite having just earned a degree in engineering. Gene's quandary precipitates a discussion of the meaning of life and its connection to God's existence. This in turn leads to vigorous debates about morality and theism, evidence for and against God's existence, probability and the rationality of belief, and the relationship between faith and reason. The strongest arguments from all three perspectives are fairly represented. An annotated list of suggested readings directs readers to relevant and helpful primary sources.<br><br>Assuming no background knowledge, <em>The God Dialogues</em> is ideal for courses in the philosophy of religion, an excellent supplement for introduction to philosophy courses, and a compelling introduction for anyone with an interest in the subject.<br></p><p><br><strong>Torin Alter</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama.<br><br><strong>Robert J.

Suppose, however, that most of the client problems that social workers encounter have more to do with the vagaries of life and not with what clients are doing wrong. This powerful idea is the philosophy behind the strengths-based approaches to social work. This groundbreaking practice handbook takes this concept one step further, combining the different strengths-based approaches into an overarching model of solution-oriented social work for greater impact. The strengths perspective emphasizes client strengths, goal-setting, and a shared definition of positive outcome. Solution-focused therapy approaches ongoing problems when they have temporarily abated, amplifying exceptions as solutions. This natural but rarely explored pairing is one component in the challenging and effective practice framework presented here by the authors, two seasoned practitioners with over 50 years of combined experience. By integrating the most useful aspects of the major approaches, a step-by-step plan for action emerges. With this text in hand, you will:<br><br>- Integrate elements from the strengths perspective, solution-focused therapy, narrative therapy, and the strategic therapy of the Mental Research Institute (the MRI approach) into an effective and eclectic framework<br>- Build and practice your skills using case examples, transcripts, and practical advice <br>- Equip yourself with the tools you need to emphasize clients' strengths<br>- Challenge the diagnosis-first medical model of behavioral health care<br>- Collaborate with clients to get past thinking (first-order change), and more to acting "outside the box" (second-order change)<br>- Learn to work with a wide variety of clients, including individuals, groups, and families; involuntary clients; clients with severe mental illness; and clients in crisis<br><br>For any student or practitioner interested in working with clients towards collaborative and empowering change, this is the essential text.<br></p><p><br>Gilbert J. Greene, PhD, is Professor and Chair of the Clinical Concentration at the College of Social Work, Ohio State University.<br><br>Mo Yee Lee, PhD, is Professor at the College of Social Work, Ohio State University.<br><br>"With a solid theoretical grounding, this comprehensive text weds solution-focused therapy to social work, a marriage built on compatibility of values and principles." --Jacqueline Corcoran, PhD, Professor of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University <br><p></p><br>"Greene and Lee have created a masterpiece. Few texts provide such a detailed look into the change processes of solution-focused practice that this book provides. It is filled with case examples and detailed micro steps that practitioners can use to help people change. The authors review all the major developments in strengths-based practice, grounding solution-oriented practice in both theory and practice methods. This is an excellent text for teaching students a solution-building process that moves beyond the traditional problem-solving methods, and towards the discovery of a different way to approach and solve problems." --Cynthia Franklin, PhD, Stiernberg/Spencer Family Professor in Mental Health, University of Texas at Austin <br><p></p><br>"Social work has long espoused a strengths-based perspective, but practice has lagged far behind-knowing doesn't translate easily to doing. This text fills that gap by showing clearly, in step-by-step fashion, not only how to think about your work but, more importantly, what you can do to become solution-oriented in your practice. Greene and Lee's approach is grounded solidly in the latest theoretical and empirical literature." --Wallace J. Gingerich, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Social Work, Case Western Reserve University <br><p></p><br>"Gil Greene and Mo Yee Lee have crafted a text that will carry on the importance of solution-focused brief therapy for the next generation. The authors have managed to integrate all the assumptions and evidence of SFBT into a practice context that is easy to follow and use. At the same time, readers will marvel at the rigor, precision, and detail that has been devoted to painstakingly pulling the best SFBT has to offer into theory, working with clients, and special applications. This book is very practical and a must-have for practitioners and instructors. I highly recommend it." --Peter Lehmann, PhD, Associate Professor of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington <br><p></p><br>"Greene and Lee have successfully filled the gap in the clinical social work literature by producing the first practice-friendly and well written solution-oriented text in the field. The authors have transcended earlier books on the solution-focused brief therapy model by integrating ideas from compatible therapeutic approaches and important findings from psychotherapy outcome research to create an expanded and advanced version of the model to make it much more effective with a wide range of client difficulties. This book is a gem and both novice and seasoned social workers will find a rich treasure trove of therapeutic tools and strategies awaiting them." --Matthew D.

Although the period of panic would dramatically influence political, cultural, and social history, those who panicked sought to erase from history their experiences of one of America&#39;s worst early financial crises. The Many Panics of 1837 reconstructs the period between March and May 1837 in order to make arguments about the national boundaries of history, the role of information in the economy, the personal and local nature of national and international events, the origins and dissemination of economic ideas, and most importantly, what actually happened in 1837. This riveting transatlantic cultural history, based on archival research on two continents, reveals how people transformed their experiences of financial crisis into the &#34;Panic of 1837,&#34; a single event that would serve as a turning point in American history and an early inspiration for business cycle theory.</p><p>This riveting transatlantic cultural history, based on archival research on two continents, reveals how people transformed their experiences of financial crisis into the &#34;Panic of 1837,&#34; a single event that would serve as a turning point in American history and an early inspiration for business cycle theory.Jessica M.

It highlights the key issues, motifs, and concerns of Mexican American women from 1848 to the present, and particularly reflects the modern Chicana's struggle for identity. Among the recurring themes in the collection is a re-visioning of foremothers such as the historical Malinche, the mythical Llorona, and pioneering women who settled the American Southwest from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries. Also included are historical documents on the lives, culture, and writings of Mexican American women in the nineteenth century, as well as oral histories recorded by the Federal Writers Project in the 1930s.<br><br> Through poetry, fiction, drama, essay, and other forms, this landmark volume showcases the talents of more than fifty authors, including Gloria E. Anzald�a, Ana Castillo, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Denise Ch�vez, Sandra Cisneros, Pat Mora, Cherr�e Moraga, and Mar�a Helena Viramontes.</p><p>Rebolledo and Rivera, who teach Spanish at the University of New Mexico, offer an intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying collection of poetry and prose by Mexican-American women. An excellent introduction provides a critical overview and helps put the pieces in their historical and literary context. The works reflect the development of a Chicana consciousness from its first seeds until the present. A section on "foremothers" collects oral and written pieces dating back to the 19th century. In one, from 1877, an aged widow recalls the deviously charitable way some priests got her a job. Sandra Cisneros, Alma Villanueva and Gloria Anzaldua provide numerous selections each, as do up-and-coming writers, such as Ines Hernandez or Marina Rivera, who offers a meditation on what it means to be of mixed blood. The title comes from Bernice Zamora's fine Whitmanesque poem about the infinitely divisible nature of identity. The pieces, however, are far too brief; most are mere snippets. Thus the editors merely whet the appetite but fail in their intention to make available hard-to-find Chicana literature. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.While researching a history of Chicana literature, editors Rebolledo and Rivero (Spanish, Univ. of New Mexico and Univ. of Arizona, respectively) discovered a wealth of feminist texts that characterize Chicana literature and culture. This collection, which includes 178 texts by 56 women, is organized historically and thematically. The first chapter includes early narratives from both oral and written traditions. Later chapters focus on personal identity, relationships within the community, and archetypes and myths. Authors include Gloria Anzaldua, Denise Chavez, Sandra Cisneros, Margarita Cota Cardenas, Pat Mora, and Antonia Quantana Pigno. Introductory essays set the tone for each new chapter, and extensive footnotes are included. Texts originally in Spanish are presented in both Spanish and English. This anthology will take its place in academic libraries with serious Hispanic American collections.<br><i>- Mary Margaret Benson, Linfield Coll., Lib., McMinnville, Ore.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Best of the Bellevue Literary Review</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A kaleidoscope of creativity . . . unsentimental and sometimes unpredictable.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i></p><p>Founded just six years ago, <i>Bellevue Literary Review </i>is already widely recognized as a rare forum for emerging and celebrated writers&#x2014;among them Julia Alvarez, Raphael Campo, Rick Moody, and Abraham Verghese&#x2014;on issues of health and healing.

Madelyn Phillips let her luggage slip to the ground, closed her eyes, and breathed deeply. No, those were the words, this was the country, and she had two weeks stretching out in front of her with nothing to do but enjoy. That she was poised to visit the Highlands when the air was full of the briskness of fall was simply the stuff of dreams. </p><p> "Get a move on, ducky.'" </p><p> Madelyn moved, thanks to a friendly shove on her backside by the man standing behind her. Thank heavens he had used his suitcase. At least she hoped he had used his suitcase. </p><p> She looked around her and realized belatedly that she was blocking the exit from the train station. In her defense it <i>had</i> been a very long day. Or maybe it had been two days. At this point she just wasn't really sure anymore. It felt like weeks since she'd slept in a horizontal position. </p><p> She moved out of Mr. Ducky's way, pulling her suitcase along behind her and trying to ignore the fact that one of the wheels had somehow become fused to something else during a too-lengthy stay near her radiator on the night before she'd left the States. She paused at the station's entrance, looked, then smiled at the sight of people driving on the wrong side of the street. She listened to the conversations wafting past her and sighed in pleasure at the lilting sounds that cascaded over her. </p><p> It was better than she'd dared hope, and she'd dared hope a lot. </p><p> She yawned suddenly, then rubbed her eyes and gave herself a shake. She didn't have time to sleep. She had much to see, much to do. Sleep could wait. She pushed away from the wall, hauled her carry-on and violin case farther up over her shoulder, took a firm grip on the handle of her no-longer-rolling roll-along suitcase, and made tracks for the local rental agency. </p><p> Half an hour and several dubious looks later--it was possible she'd yawned one too many times--she was the possessor of keys and a very unsatisfactory map of the Highlands. She put it into her notebook with great reluctance, though she supposed she didn't have to look at it. After all, she had directions to the inn where she was staying from the proprietor himself. He could no doubt tell her where to find a map that had more roads drawn on it than this. </p><p> Unless these were all the roads there were. </p><p> Then again, fewer roads, fewer people. Less things to run over on her first day. Maybe that was a good thing. </p><p> She hauled her gear to the car, put it in the trunk, and managed to get herself behind the steering wheel on the correct side of the car without any undue stress or confusion. </p><p> "Drive on the left,'" she reminded herself as she negotiated her way through the parking lot. That was a little unsettling in and of itself, but it was nothing compared to trying to blend in with the local traffic. She wondered why rental agencies didn't grill potential renters about their level of jetlag before handing over any keys. </p><p> She took a deep breath and put her foot on the gas. She had a few hair--raising near misses with pedestrians, cars, and other bits of unyielding curb material, then she was quite suddenly on the road out of town. The road narrowed and the accompanying traffic eased up as well. She relaxed her death grip on the steering wheel and let herself smile. </p><p> She was in Scotland. It was almost too good to be true. </p><p> She could pinpoint the precise moment when her fascination with the country had begun. Her father had come home from a conference in Edinburgh and brought her a little statue of a Highlander playing the bagpipes. And for some reason, that had set fire to her ten--year--old's imagination. Her father had never traveled to the UK without bringing her back something Scottish, even if he'd purchased it at Heathrow. Child--sized bagpipes, kilts, books: All had served to deepen her fascination with a land that boasted so many lochs, such a rich history, and such a fiercely independent people. </p><p> Of course, an elaborate teenage fantasy about an ultra--buff Highland lord who would fall madly in love with her the moment he saw her hadn't done anything to blunt her enthusiasm, either. </p><p> She'd wanted to come to the Highlands for years. She'd wanted to touch the stones with her own hands, to roam the land on her own two feet and imagine who might have walked there before her, see the lochs and mountains with her own eyes and envy those who called them home. Even when school and career had taken the lion's share of her time and money, she'd always kept Scotland in the back of her mind. </p><p> And, she had to admit with a good bit of chagrin, she'd always kept that daydream of that handsome Highland lad in the back of her mind as well. </p><p> It was a good thing she'd just recently sworn off men, or she might have been distracted on her trip. After her last relationship, she'd decided to give them up for at least a decade or so. She just couldn't imagine anyone changing her mind. Besides, she was in Scotland to see the country, not find a man. That Highland lord could just look elsewhere. </p><p> She put all thoughts of impossible fantasies behind her and concentrated on the fields and forests that were full of autumn color. She rolled down the window and savored the chill in the air. Fall was by far her favorite season. It was full of promise for mornings spent lingering over a hearty breakfast before going outside to shovel leaves, afternoons spent watching the leaves wearing their autumn colors, evenings spent reading next to a roaring fire. Sweaters, boots, scarves: even the clothing worked for her. </p><p> Of course, she didn't have any of that really great fall--type clothing. What she had was a suitcase full of business attire, very expensive business attire, but that was a different story entirely. At least the obscenely expensive black shoes she was wearing were comfortable. It almost made up for the nylons that had slouched their way down her thighs and seemed determined to slide even farther. She didn't dare tug. They were her last pair, and she didn't have any money for others. </p><p> So to take her mind off her migrating legwear, she forced herself to admire charming stone houses separated by equally charming stone fences and pay attention to the delightfully winding road leading past them. </p><p> After a while, though, the road began to feel like one endless ribbon that wove its way in a rather haphazard fashion through the countryside, and she began to feel a little disconnected. Soon she wondered if she'd slipped into a trance. Things were becoming very peaceful. </p><p> Or at least they were until she glanced in her rearview mirror and found a black car of indeterminate origin suddenly crawling up her tail as if it had every intention of taking up residence in her trunk. She was invited to pull over with a series of friendly toots on the horn. </p><p> All right, so the guy was actually leaning on the horn as if he'd collapsed there. Not even being passed, seeing a ferocious scowl tossed her way as the man slowed in his passing to make sure she knew he was irritated, followed immediately by an acceleration so rapid she had to roll up the window to avoid road dust blinding her, was enough to sour her determinedly cheerful mood. She happily flipped the rapidly disappearing sportscar the bird and continued on her way. </p><p> The road continued northward and soon it began to wind with more enthusiasm. Her driving skills were definitely improving because she found herself growing used to driving on the wrong side of the road. She even managed to avoid various and sundry bits of animal husbandry that seemed to find warm, fallish tarmac to be to their liking. She'd never thought of sheep as a road hazard, but there you had it. When in Scotland, look out for white, fuzzy impediments to your journey. </p><p> If only the natives would take that advice, they would probably get a lot farther in their travels. </p><p> This was something she decided as she rounded yet another corner and found herself facing a traffic tableau that brought her foot into forceful and sudden contact with her brakes. </p><p> Mr. Black Sportscar was standing by the side of the road, looking at his beautiful car, which was now facing the wrong direction and sporting an enormous scrape down one side. Madelyn pulled over. No sense in adding to the tragedy by becoming a road hazard herself. She rolled down her window and poked her head out to look at the man who was speaking quite enthusiastically in a language she supposed had to be Gaelic. He was coming close to tearing his hair out. </p><p> Then he stopped and turned to look at her. </p><p> And she felt her mouth go dry. </p><p> All right, so she was sleep--deprived. She was also probably overloaded with too many expectations and too much airline food. And it was also possible that her social life was so far in the toilet that anything that looked passable in jeans and a black sweater seemed like a dream come true. </p><p> It was possible. </p><p> Or not. </p><p> Nope, there was just no denying that the man before her was simply, undeniably stunning. Tall, dark, unbelievably handsome. She tried valiantly to remember why it was she'd sworn off men. Not that it would have mattered. This guy was reason enough to deep--six that resolution. </p><p> And surely he had a fabulous personality to match that incredible face and impressive physique. Charming, strong--willed but chivalrous. She could only imagine what sort of gallant reply he would give to the offer of aid she couldn't not give. Really. It was the right thing to do. </p><p> "Need help?" she asked in her most helpful tone of voice. </p><p> He stopped his swearing and turned to look at her. </p><p> So it was more of a glare than a look. Maybe he'd had a bad day. </p><p> "Help me?" he snarled. "<i>Help</i> me? Nay, you cannot help me, unless you'd care to go along before me and sweep the sheep from the bloody road where they don't belong!" </p><p> She blinked. Okay, maybe his chivalry had been buried under all the paint he'd scraped off the side of his car. She couldn't blame him. But as far as sweeping sheep went, she doubted it would do all that much good. His car didn't look as if it was going to go far enough for sweeping to become an issue. She turned her mind to more practical matters. </p><p> "Need a ride?" </p><p> He swore at her--she was quite certain he had--then stomped over to his exceedingly scratched door, opened it, threw himself inside. He managed to get the door shut with only a minor struggle. He whipped a U-turn, then flung his damaged car down the road with rather unwise abandon, to her mind. </p><p> Well, looks were deceiving, it seemed. His car was fully functional, but his manners were definitely not. She sighed. So her first contact with indigenous culture had been a bust--her father would have been appalled at her inability to ascertain the man's linguistic origins in ten words or less--but in spite of all that, maybe things would look up soon. After all, no sheep were lying dead on the road, she still had her car intact, and she'd been witness to a helping of just desserts. </p><p> Not bad, considering the alternatives. </p><p> She put her car back in gear and continued on her way, happily humming a tune and looking forward with eagerness to a decent dinner and a good night's rest. The sooner she was acclimated to her new time zone, the better use of her time she would be able to make. </p><p> It was rather late in the day when she finally reached the village of Benmore. She didn't bother consulting her map of the village because she'd already memorized it. She wound her way up to Roddy MacLeod's small inn. </p><p> She parked next to a very expensive-looking Jaguar, then turned her car off and sighed deeply. Safe and sound with a bed in her immediate future. Miraculous. </p><p> She dragged herself from the car, grabbed her purse from the front seat and her violin from the trunk, then made tracks for the front door. The entryway was neat and clean, but humble. She loved it on sight. But she hadn't taken but a handful of steps inside before she came to a screeching halt. </p><p> She sniffed. </p><p> A feeling of horror washed over her. </p><p> Not Eternal Riches cologne. </p><p> She rubbed her nose vigorously on the off chance that she was imagining things. But no, she wasn't. After all, who could mistake that for anything but what it was, especially given the permeation ratio she was currently experiencing? </p><p> Before she could decide between swearing and screaming, a middle-aged, ruddy-haired, ruddy-complected man came out, wiping his hands on a towel. He looked at her with a smile. </p><p> "May I help you?" he asked. </p><p> "I'm Madelyn Phillips. I have a reservation." </p><p> The man stared at her in surprise. "Miss Phillips," he said, blinking in surprise. "Aye, you did have a reservation, but..." </p><p> Did? Did he say <i>did?</i> Madelyn ignored the sinking feeling in her stomach--and the fierce itching in her nose. </p><p> "I called before I left the States," she said. "To confirm. You are Roddy MacLeod, aren't you?" </p><p> "Aye, I am," he said, beginning to look very unsettled. "But Mr. Taylor said you'd made other arrangements at the last moment." </p><p> Madelyn gritted her teeth. "He didn't. He couldn't have." </p><p> "Ah, but I could and I did." </p><p> Madelyn looked to her right to see a man emerging from the darkness of the hallway like a damned vampire come to look over the evening's offerings and offer his opinion on how they were lacking. </p><p> Bentley Douglas Taylor III. Her former fiance. The man who had left her with no money, no job, and no apartment. </p><p> Was it bad to loathe another human being? </p><p> She glared at him. "You stole my reservation," she said, putting her hand over her nose so she wasn't quite so assaulted by his cologne. </p><p> "It was the honeymoon suite--such as it is, and it isn't much. I didn't think you would want it." </p><p> "What I wouldn't want is to share it with <i>you."</i> </p><p> Bentley removed a toothpick from between his teeth--he carried them in a silver case in his shirt pocket--and sucked those teeth, probably to retrieve whatever expensive lunch he had stowed there for later inspection. "Madelyn, you aren't being a very good sport about this." </p><p> What in the world had ever possessed her to agree once upon a time to marry the man standing in front of her? Obviously some sort of momentary loss of all rational thought. Bentley Douglas Taylor III was suave; he was handsome; he was powerful. He had also dumped her six weeks before their wedding only to turn around and become engaged to someone else approximately six minutes later.

As an employee for the state radio system, she had long wanted to help improve the lives of Chinese women. But when she was given clearance to host a radio call-in show, she barely anticipated the enthusiasm it would quickly generate. Operating within the constraints imposed by government censors, &#x201c;Words on the Night Breeze&#x201d; sparked a tremendous outpouring, and the hours of tape on her answering machines were soon filled every night. Whether angry or muted, posing questions or simply relating experiences, these anonymous women bore witness to decades of civil strife, and of halting attempts at self-understanding in a painfully restrictive society. In this collection, by turns heartrending and inspiring, Xinran brings us the stories that affected her most, and offers a graphically detailed, altogether unprecedented work of oral history.</p><p>&#x201c;Groundbreaking....

Yorkshire Dales)</h2><p>This new, thoroughly updated edition of the <em>Yorkshire Dales</em>, part of Bradt's series of distinctive &#x2018;Slow' guides to local UK regions, remains the most comprehensive guide to the area and covers the whole of the recently extended Yorkshire Dales National Park, Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and some &#x2018;slow' and historic towns and villages just outside the boundaries.Each chapter covers, dale by dale, wildlife, folklore, history and local food and drink and suggests routes to follow to see the best of it all. Walking and cycling are included, as well as all the attractions and advice needed for a memorable visit. The Yorkshire Dales is famous internationally for its caves, scenic rivers, waterfalls and limestone flora, but it is also known in the USA for a diverse range of connections, from the lead on the roofs of the White House and Capitol Building to Roosters brewery collaborating with Pretty Things Brewery in Massachusetts. Richmond, Virginia is the largest city bearing the name but Richmond, North Yorkshire is the oldest and the one that all others are named after, while Cravendale in North Carolina is named after a 17th-century son of the Lord Mayor of London who began life as a poor farmhand in Appletreewick, Wharfedale. Knitting, President Roosevelt, Ripon in Wisconsin and a square mile of Yorkshire that is officially American soil also link the region to the USA. The Yorkshire Dales offer hundreds of square miles of open access land to explore, long-distance footpaths including the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast, medieval castles such as Skipton and Richmond, quaint stone villages and an exceptionally rich wildlife. Drop in to the Tan Hill Inn, the highest pub in Britain where sheep regularly find their way in to warm themselves by the roaring fire; journey into the depths of Gaping Gill, one of the largest underground chambers in Britain; or take a scenic rail trip on the famous Settle-Carlisle line, crossing en route the longest railway viaduct in the country at Ribblehead.

Now the living moved among them as men whose joints had aged a scoreof years, tongues held captive by grief and outrage. Jeremiah&#x2019;s friend, the Mingo, Logan, wept in silence beside the body of a young woman, his sister Koonay.<br>Jeremiah felt his gorge rise as it had at first sight of Koonay. Someone had draped a blanket over her after cutting her down from the tree in which her body was found hanging, but they&#x2019;d all seen what was done toher. Koonay had been heavy with her second child, but not even the unborn had escaped this slaughter. No one had yet found her firstborn, a daughter, two years old, though they knew she&#x2019;d been with her mother in one of the canoes that crossed the Ohio Riverto Baker&#x2019;s post, a thing done in friendship many times before.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t only Koonay whom Logan grieved. Jeremiah choked back his own sorrow, watching the man absorb the slaughter of nearly all the blood kin he&#x2019;d had in this world&#x2014;his older brother, his mother, his nephew, hissister, her unborn child. The few warriors who&#x2019;d accompanied them, slain along with his kin, had been Logan&#x2019;s friends.<br>For the first time since he&#x2019;d met the man, Jeremiah felt chary of approaching Logan, stony-faced even as he wept for his dead. Logan&#x2019;s warriors backed away, leaving them alone.<br>&#x201c;Cresap.&#x201d; Logan didn&#x2019;t look at Jeremiah as he spat the name in a strangled voice. &#x201c;He has done this.&#x201d;<br>Jeremiah felt his gut twist. Michael Cresap, trader and land hunter, had made it plain he meant to slaughter any Indians unlucky enough to cross his path. This was due in large part to rumors being spread by MajorJohn Connolly, commander at Fort Pitt, who&#x2019;d gone so far as to assert the Ohio Indians&#x2014;Shawnees and Mingos&#x2014;were on the verge of striking the frontier settlements in open war. Cresap had decided to strike first. But had the man grown so hard, so heartless, tohave done <i>this</i>?<br>Whoever was to blame, the senseless killings were bound to escalate an already tenuous situation on the Ohio. Until now, Mingos like Logan, along with many Shawnee chiefs including their principle chief, Cornstalk,had counseled against open warfare with the whites invading their hunting grounds south of the river. These whites weren&#x2019;t traders, who&#x2019;d come among them for years, beginning with the French. Nor were they missionaries, who&#x2019;d settled among the Delawares andnow had whole villages of Christian converts. These men came to blaze the trees and cut them down, to put up cabins and corn, kill the game and fill the land with cattle and hogs; an endless stream of settlers spilling down the Ohio like floodwaters.<br>Fiery young warriors, seeing their hunting grounds taken, couldn&#x2019;t always be controlled by elders who urged peace. Even the Shawnee war chief, Puckeshinwah, who&#x2019;d spent the past months in talks with the Indian agentsat Fort Pitt, was ready to raise the war club in the face of Virginia Governor Dunmore&#x2019;s inability to stem the tide of illegal settlement down the Ohio.<br>Three days ago, Jeremiah had left the frustrated Puckeshinwah and his Shawnee delegation in Pittsburgh and descended the Ohio with Koonay&#x2019;s husband, the white trader John Gibson, hoping to discover whether the alarmingrumors being spread about Indian attacks had basis in fact. Assured by a band of Shawnees met on the river that their warriors hadn&#x2019;t been out killing whites, Gibson felt sure the rumors were false. Major Connolly was attempting to excite alarm, likely to furthersome land-grabbing scheme of Governor Dunmore&#x2019;s to snatch up the Ohio territory before Pennsylvania could claim it. Gibson had traded canoes for packhorses and continued overland toward the Shawnee towns on the Scioto River to do his trading.<br>Less sanguine about the rumors, Jeremiah had turned his canoe for Yellow Creek. Surely Logan&#x2019;s warriors weren&#x2019;t raiding across the river&#x2014;he was known widely as a friend to the white man&#x2014;but perhaps he&#x2019;d know if otherswere.<br>Logan had been away at a hunting camp when Jeremiah arrived, but what caused a true disquiet was learning Logan&#x2019;s family had crossed to Baker&#x2019;s post, lured by the invitation of some white men promising whiskey. Distantshots had echoed across the river almost before the news was shared. Jeremiah had gone over by canoe with the warriors sent to investigate, only to be repelled by more gunfire. Runners had been sent to Logan&#x2019;s hunting camp to bring him in. That morning they&#x2019;dfinally made it ashore, to find the dead lying scalped and mutilated, the killers long fled.<br>Jeremiah sought for words to fill a mouth gone dusty. He wanted to comfort Logan, caution him not to rush to blame, say something to turn aside what could easily follow this atrocity&#x2014;a full-scale border war. To mindrose memory of Koonay&#x2019;s lifeless face, beaten almost beyond recognition, and he thought it would take a rare man, faced with such violation, to turn aside from vengeance.<br>&#x201c;Maybe it was Cresap. Maybe not. Surely the Indian agents at Pittsburgh will...&#x201d;<br>Jeremiah fell silent when Logan&#x2019;s gaze lifted, knowing nothing he could say would matter. What he&#x2019;d seen this day would haunt Jeremiah for his next thirty years, should he live so long. So would what he read in thetormented eyes turned on him now. Where once had leapt the flame of friendship for Jeremiah&#x2019;s race, there blazed a hatred mere words could never douse.<br>Alarm crawled over Jeremiah&#x2019;s scalp. Not for himself. In Logan&#x2019;s eyes he was no longer a white man. His alarm was for every settler fool enough to linger west of the mountains after today.<br>Logan seemed to read his thoughts. Lifting his shoulders until he stood lance-straight, fingers curving round the tomahawk thrust through his sash, the Mingo bound Jeremiah with that burning gaze.<br>&#x201c;For every life here taken from me,&#x201d; he said though lips set tight with rage, &#x201c;by my hand ten whites will die. <i>Ten.</i> In your hearing this day I vow it. Go and tell what has beendone here if you will. Speak for these ones who have no more voice. But do not promise peace. Not from Logan.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br>May 6, 1774<br>Virginia Colony, western frontier<br>Clare Margaret Inglesby, twenty-six years of age and eight months with child, wondered how she&#x2019;d come to this: trapped in a joltingwagon advancing into perilous wilderness.<br>She clenched her teeth to prevent them rattling out of her head and to hold back the flood of grievance amassing on her tongue. Though in danger of losing hairpins, cap, and sundry other trappings to the buckingof their conveyance, that was nothing to the sense of impending disaster that had dogged her every mile they&#x2019;d traveled from the place they&#x2019;d last called home, the Augusta County farm belonging to Clare&#x2019;s uncle, Alphus Litchfield.<br>In seven years of marriage, the Inglesbys had never owned a home of their own, despite all Philip&#x2019;s promises.<br><i>And likely never shall,</i> she thought, as the forest west of Redstone Fort enclosed them in its dark embrace for a second day of misery. The men of Redstone had warned Philipthe track they followed was unsuitable for a wagon&#x2019;s passage, suggesting they go by canoe instead.<br>Philip had dismissed their advice. He was in a hurry to reach Wheeling Settlement and hadn&#x2019;t the patience to wait for a canoe to be built. James Harrod and his settlers, whom Philip meant to join up with, were saidto be in Wheeling, but only for a short time before they departed downriver. If they could reach Wheeling quickly, Philip had maintained, they were bound to catch Harrod&#x2019;s party.<br>Always certain he could find a way or make one was Philip, no matter the inevitable disappointment that followed.<br><i>Inevitable. </i>Precisely when had she transformed into a woman of such dark presentiment? Had this nagging expectation of doom been her companion before she became Philip&#x2019;swife?<br>Perhaps she&#x2019;d made passing acquaintance with it then, even as she and Philip ignored her father&#x2019;s cautioning and wed under the cloud of devastation that had settled over Philip and his mother with the self-perpetrateddeath of his father and the ruination of their fortunes.<br>Certainly she&#x2019;d done so five years later when, reduced to tenancy after repeated failures to regain said fortune, she and Philip had cast themselves upon the mercy of Clare&#x2019;s uncle and left Richmond, with its cobbledstreets, bustling shops, and established society&#x2014;and painful memories&#x2014;to move onto Alphus Litchfield&#x2019;s vacant farm in the Shenandoah Valley.<br>There&#x2019;d been no place else to go, for Philip had flatly refused to seek the aid of her parents yet again.<br>&#x201c;Only for a while,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d assured her. &#x201c;Until we get our feet under us.&#x201d; A year. Maybe two.<br>Clare, who&#x2019;d taken to farming with a liking that surprised no one more than herself, began to hope they&#x2019;d found their place at last, however modest. Perhaps one day Uncle Alphus, who operated a gristmill in nearbyStaunton, might be induced to sell the land to them.<br>Six months later the name <i>Harrod</i> fell from Philip&#x2019;s lips. Hot on its heels came <i>Kentucky.</i><br>She&#x2019;d opposed his intention of uprooting them again and making for the Ohio frontier, where land was fast being surveyed and claimed despite King George&#x2019;s Proclamation meant to halt settlement at the crest of theAllegheny Mountains.<br>&#x201c;The wording of the Proclamation isn&#x2019;t clear on that point,&#x201d; Philip had argued. &#x201c;There are grants to be made to veterans of the French War, land that must be found west of the mountains.&#x201d; The Proclamation Line couldnever have been intended as a <i>permanent</i> demarcation, Philip had reasoned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a matter of time before the Ohio country is officially open to settlement. We must be among the first!&#x201d;<br>Clare had shuddered in the face of his enthusiasm. Who could say what fate awaited them across the mountains, or who might be nearby to aid them when that fate&#x2014;bedecked in war paint&#x2014;chose to descend upon them, hatchetsraised? Though her own troubles had risen large in recent years, she was aware enough of the wider world to know the land for which they made wasn&#x2019;t truly unclaimed.<br>Had it ever ended well when the worlds of red and white men collided?<br>Such collision had occurred just miles from Uncle Alphus&#x2019;s farm. Years ago, raiding Indians had stolen a young pregnant bride right out of her cabin while her husband was away. The husband had abandoned his farmand gone tearing off into the wilderness after his wife. Neither ever returned. Clare couldn&#x2019;t recall their name: Bud, perhaps? Or was it Bloom? Regardless, the story haunted her.<br>Now here she was pushing deep into territory where such unspeakable things still happened.<br>&#x201c;Why not stay on Uncle Alphus&#x2019;s farm?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d pleaded. &#x201c;He requires someone to work it, and he&#x2019;s welcomed us here as long as needs be.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, Clare.&#x201d; As always, Philip&#x2019;s eyes had looked beyond what rested safe in his hand to something more he wished to grasp. &#x201c;I cannot abide it, farming another man&#x2019;s land.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it the lack of ownership or the farming itself to which you object?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked, having her suspicions. &#x201c;If the latter, how will it be better where land must first be cleared?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better in every way!&#x201d; Philip had countered, sidestepping her primary question. &#x201c;The land east of the mountains is overworked. But the west&#x2014;the <i>west</i> is untouched. Virgin soil.The yield there will be bountiful beyond anything we&#x2019;ve seen. More yield for less toil. <i>Think</i> of it, Clare.&#x201d;<br>She thought of the hardships of wilderness travel. She thought of hacking out a forest of massive trees to lay bare a patch of that virgin soil. Of raising a cabin with a hatchet and their hands. Of bearing her childin a wilderness.<br>It was all she could do not to weep. &#x201c;Why not wait, at least until after the baby is born?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If we wait, the best land will be claimed. You&#x2019;ve heard how many settlers are passing through Pittsburgh and Redstone, all with the same aim in mind as have we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As have <i>you.</i>&#x201d; Philip never seemed to grasp that distinction. &#x201c;And what about Indians?&#x201d;<br>He had waved away that most abiding of her terrors as if it were a gnat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been peaceful for months. Likely there&#x2019;s so many of us coming downriver now they&#x2019;ve thought better of provoking us. They&#x2019;ll give way.Move west. They always have. It&#x2019;s inevitable.&#x201d;<br><i>Inevitable.</i><br>Rehearsing that conversation and others like it for the hundredth time, still trying to find the thing she might have said&#x2014;might still say&#x2014;to divert this disastrous course her husband had set, Clare scanned the trailahead. It leveled into a wider, straight stretch with no trees or rocks to maneuver the cumbersome wagon around. She swiveled to peer deeper into the canvas-covered bed where their son, Jacob, rode cushioned in a nest of cornmeal sacks, tucked between the fewcherished furnishings they&#x2019;d had room to bring along.</p><h2>Days of Gold: A Novel (Edilean)</h2><p>Angus McTern is respected by the men of his clan and adored by the women.

Although his grandfather lost the family's land and castle in a card game when Angus was just a boy, Angus takes his duties seriously and is respected by all the men and adored by the women. That is, until Edilean Talbot shows up.</p><p> Breathtakingly beautiful and born of privilege, Edilean represents everything Angus despises. Still he is as dazzled by her as everyone else is, and he can keep his feelings hidden from her for only so long. When she rejects him he is deeply wounded and, worse, humiliated before his clan. But then the day comes when Edilean needs Angus's help, to reclaim the gold she inherited from her father, which is on its way to America. At first Angus refuses, but her beauty--and her tears--so haunt him that he puts aside his pride and decides to aid the heiress. However, when Angus tries to intervene, he's accused of kidnapping and theft. To avoid being prosecuted, he's forced to leave behind all that he knows and loves and escape with Edilean to America. There they will overcome almost insurmountable obstacles as they are pursued endlessly by the man who claims the gold for his own. Despite all that tries to keep them apart, Angus and Edilean also find a love as wild and free as the land itself.</p><p> The second book in the multigenerational Edilean Series that began with <em>Lavender Morning</em>, <i>Days of Gold</i> is filled with passion, humor, exquisite detail, and pulse-pounding adventure. Stirring and masterfully rendered, this is Jude Deveraux at her best. </p> <p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Note to Readers from Author Jude Deveraux</strong><br><br> </p><p>I came to write <i>Days of Gold</i> because I was curious. In the early pages of <em>Lavender Morning</em>, I'd written a few sentences about the founding of the little town I'd created, Edilean, Virginia. They briefly told the story of a young man kidnapping a rich man's daughter, along with a wagon full of gold, and taking her to America. All through the writing of <em>Lavender Morning</em>, I wondered about that story. Had the young woman been taken away forcibly, or had she run off of her own free will? By the time I finished the book, I knew I had to find out the answers to my questions. I decided to write my first historical in eight years, the story of the founders of Edilean, Virginia.<br><br> I very much enjoyed writing the book. It was fun to again visualize kilts and horses, and a huge sailing ship headed for the newly formed American colonies. I loved the attempts of my hero, Angus, to be noble and Edilean, my heroine, as she got angry at him when he made decisions without consulting her. My favorite scene in the books is when Edilean nearly shoots Angus. By that time, he deserved being shot!<br><br> I also fell in love with the people around them. I felt so sorry for Prudence, the wife of the awful man, James, that I knew I had to give her a good ending. I truly loved her and Shamus! By the time I finished <i>Days of Gold</i>, I had a better idea of how Edilean started, and about all the people of Edilean. When I wrote my next contemporary novel, <em>Scarlet Nights</em>, I could see where people had come from, and had an idea of where they were going.<br><br> --<i>Jude Deveraux</i> <br> </p>Jude Deveraux is the author of&nbsp;more than forty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Moonlight in the Morning</i>, <i>The Scent of Jasmine</i>, <i>Scarlet Nights</i>, <i>Days of Gold</i>,<i> Lavender Morning</i>, <i>Return to Summerhouse</i>, and <i>Secrets. </i>To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.

Harding, an obscure Ohio senator, to serve as our twenty-third president. Harding and his &#x201c;oil cabinet&#x201d; made it possible for cronies to secure vast fuel reserves that had been set aside for use by the U.S. Navy. In exchange, the oilmen paid off senior government officials, bribed newspaper publishers, and covered the GOP campaign debt. When news of the scandal finally emerged, the consequences were disastrous. Drawing on contemporary records newly made available to McCartney, <i>The Teapot Dome Scandal</i> reveals a shocking, revelatory picture of just how far-reaching the affair was, how high the stakes, and how powerful the conspirators&#x2013;all told in a dazzling narrative style.</p><p>Laton McCartney is the author of the national bestseller <i>Friends in High Places: The Bechtel Story&#x2013;The Most Secret Corporation and How It Engineered the World</i> and <i>Across the Great Divide: Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail.</i> McCartney has written extensively on business, finance, and politics for many national magazines. He and his wife, Nancy, divide their time between Wyoming and New York.1 A Reversal of Fortune<br><br>Ardmore, Oklahoma, November 21, 1920<br><br>&#x201c;The Oil King of Oklahoma&#x201d; came back to the Randal Hotel and flopped down on the bed in room 28 without undressing. It was just after 6:00 p.m. Jake Hamon had been drinking most of the afternoon. He needed a nap if he was going to make supper.<br><br>Clara Hamon was in the adjoining room when Jake came in. She listened as he dropped his keys and change on the bureau and collapsed on the bed. She and Jake had been together ten years. They shared the Hamon name but were neither married nor related. A few months after they met, Jake had paid his nephew Frank Hamon $10,000 to marry Clara and then sent him off on the first train to California. The marriage had been a &#x201c;blind.&#x201d; Jake wanted Clara for himself. Sharing the Hamon name made it easier for them to travel together, registering in hotels as Jake and Clara Hamon.<br><br>Jake had left his wife and two children for Clara. A clerk in a dry goods store, Clara had been seventeen at the time, eighteen years Jake&#x2019;s junior. With her wavy brown hair modestly done up, her deep blue eyes, and her reluctance to wear rouge, she looked more like an attractive young schoolteacher than Jake Hamon&#x2019;s mistress. After they met, Jake offered her a job, sent her to stenography school, and took her out to the oil fields with him when he&#x2019;d been wildcatting on the Osage and up on the Panhandle. Clara was smart and every bit as ambitious as Jake. For the past few years, she&#x2019;d been acting as his business partner and adviser. &#x201c;He was . . . a masterful man,&#x201d; Clara said. &#x201c;He dominated me from the first time I looked into his eyes and noted the strange glint in them.&#x201d;<br><br>Now Jake had hit the big time, the jackpot of all jackpots. Not even in his wildest dreams could he have imagined the good fortune that had recently befallen him. Until six months ago, Jake had been a big fish in a pond that was far too small to accommodate his vast ambitions. &#x201c;The Oil King of Oklahoma,&#x201d; the newspapers called him. The raucous, hard-drinking Hamon had graduated from the Law Department of the University of Kansas, then set off for Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), where he clerked in a store in Newkirk. When the Kiowa-Comanche country opened up to settlement, Jake went in with the first rush of new settlers to Lawton, then an Indian town. Over the next few years, he had been named Lawton&#x2019;s first city attorney and chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Territorial Committee; made money building a railroad with John Ringling, the circus impresario; and then got into oil, where the real money was.<br><br>With the 1920 presidential election coming up, Jake decided to gamble almost everything he had on backing a long shot in the 1920 Republican presidential convention, Senator Warren G. Harding from Ohio. Hamon borrowed nearly $1 million from the National City Bank of New York (today&#x2019;s Citibank), using his substantial oil holdings as collateral. He took his bankroll to Chicago and spread his money around where it counted, buying delegates and influencing the people who needed influencing. Working in tandem with Harding&#x2019;s campaign manager, Harry Micajah Daugherty, Hamon got Warren Harding the Republican presidential nomination.<br><br>Six months later, Warren Harding was elected president of the United States. Going into the convention, Harding had been a forty-to-one shot. Hamon agreed to back him on the condition that if he was nominated&#x2014;and made it to the White House&#x2014;Harding would appoint Hamon secretary of the interior. That would give Hamon control of the Teapot Dome Naval Reserve in Wyoming, an oil supply potentially worth several hundred million dollars&#x2014;1920 dollars&#x2014;a bonanza so rich that it was almost beyond comprehension. Of course, Jake wasn&#x2019;t going to pocket it all. He agreed to lease out the government fields to some of his friends in the oil business, who in turn would kick back a third of the take to Jake.<br><br>Hamon had a fortune within his grasp that could put him in the same league as old John D. Rockefeller, the richest man in America. And Jake already knew what he was going to do with a big chunk of the money&#x2014;make his son president of the United States. If Hamon and Big Oil could get an empty suit like Harding elected, putting a bright, ambitious kid like Jake Jr. in the White House would be a breeze when the time came. Of course, there was a caveat regarding the Interior post. Initially, Jake hadn&#x2019;t thought the matter would prove a problem, but he&#x2019;d been badly mistaken. When Hamon and Harding first met in New York before the convention, they discovered to their mutual amazement that their wives were related&#x2014;second cousins, in fact. This, of course, had given Jake a big &#x201c;in&#x201d; with Harding, but it also presented a problem. Once &#x201c;the Duchess,&#x201d; as Harding called his wife, Florence, got the lowdown on Jake and Clara, she insisted that Jake get back with his wife before coming to Washington. Florence Harding wasn&#x2019;t going to allow her cousin&#x2019;s husband to come to Washington accompanied by some twenty-seven-year-old floozy.<br><br>Clara had to go.<br><br>Harding spelled out the demands in a letter Jake had brought back from the Chicago convention, packed in his trunk. It stated unequivocally that Hamon had to resume his legal marital relations before he could be considered for an appointment. Not that Harding cared one way or another. He chased anything in a skirt; that was no secret. But Florence was a tough old bird. There was no getting around her.<br><br>Of course, Jake waited until after Harding won the election to break the bad news to Clara. No point in getting her all riled up until he was sure Harding had the job. Clara wasn&#x2019;t the kind of woman you wanted to give up unless you had a good reason, and Jake had two of the best&#x2014;money and power. Jake would be generous in settling with her, of course. He&#x2019;d already given Clara a couple of oil wells from which she received small royalties. He&#x2019;d instructed his business manager, Frank Ketch, to work out a reasonable agreement. Clara would walk away from their ten-year relationship a well-to-do woman with enough to put her younger brother, Jimmy, through college and take care of her ailing father, J. T. Smith, down in El Paso. Back a decade or so ago, J.T. had come after Jake with a pistol for having absconded with poor innocent Clara. Fortunately, the sheriff managed to disarm him before he could do any damage.<br><br>Old J.T. had a nasty temper, but then so did Clara, though she had seemed calm enough when Jake told her that he had to leave her, that he was going back to his wife. Icy calm, in fact. He broke the news on November 7 and gave Clara three weeks to clear out, explaining that his wife and family would be arriving at the end of the month in Ardmore.<br><br>God knows, Jake told Clara, he hadn&#x2019;t wanted it to end this way, not after ten years, didn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;d do without her. Jake wanted nothing more than to bring Clara with him to Washington, take her to black-tie dinners at the White House and formal balls, have her meet heads of state, even royalty, but the president-elect of the United States had insisted. Either get back with his wife or forget about the Interior job. What choice did he have?<br><br>The day after Jake broke the news, Clara went out and bought a .25-caliber pistol. That, Jake hadn&#x2019;t known. What he knew was that Clara had started packing and seemed resigned to the breakup. It was only a matter of a few days now before she&#x2019;d be off. In fact, when he got back to the hotel on the evening of November 21, he half expected that she would have already gone. Instead, she came into Jake&#x2019;s room from the adjoining room, her room, after he toppled onto the bed. He was awake, if a little woozy from the whiskey. It was nearly dark. Clara came over to the bed and put her left hand on Jake&#x2019;s forehead as if to stroke it and with her right shot him in the chest with the .25-caliber pistol. Pop&#x2014;one shot that pierced his ribs and lodged in his liver.<br><br>Jake jumped up from the bed, knocked the gun from Clara&#x2019;s hand before she could get off a second round, and then began crawling around the floor on his hands and knees, clutching the chest wound with one hand and looking for the tiny pistol with the other in the near darkness. Finally he retrieved the gun, put it in his pocket, and staggered to his feet to confront Clara.<br><br>&#x201c;Clara, you hit me,&#x201d; Jake said, looking at the blood that had begun to soak through his vest and now covered his hand.<br><br>Clara would later claim that she pleaded with Jake to lie back down on the bed. She wanted to call for Dr. Walter Hardy, the town doctor, but Jake was determined to walk to the nearby Hardy Sanitarium himself. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call it an accident,&#x201d; he said as he staggered out the door. That suited Clara just fine. She wanted Jake Hamon dead, and she wanted it to appear as if he&#x2019;d shot himself while cleaning his pistol. She told her driver so the following day.</p><h2>Losing the Field (Field Party)</h2><p><b>The fourth book in the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Field Party series&#x2014;a southern soap opera with football, cute boys, and pick-up trucks&#x2014;from <i>USA TODAY </i>bestselling author Abbi Glines.</b><br><br>Tallulah Liddell had been defined by her appearance for as long as she could remember.

I&#x2019;d heard that question as I passed at least three other groups of students. People I&#x2019;d gone to school with since preschool. I had often wondered if some of them even knew my name. They never spoke to me. Hardly acknowledged me.<br> <br>I had blamed them for so long. However, over the summer I&#x2019;d come to realize a lot of things. One being I was the one who tried to be invisible. I was shy. I didn&#x2019;t want attention drawn to me. Often when I did get attention it was hurtful, and I kept to the shadows as much as possible. So if they didn&#x2019;t know my name, then it was because I had done nothing notable. Nothing to look back on one day and be proud of.<br> <br>This year would be different. I wasn&#x2019;t hiding now. I was tired of being the butt of everyone&#x2019;s jokes. I would make my senior year one to remember. One to be proud of. I was even going to join . . . something. Maybe the yearbook staff or possibly try out for the dance team. I could dance. That was my little secret. When I had weighed more than society thought I should, I hadn&#x2019;t wanted to dance in front of anyone. It was something I did alone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, new girl!&#x201d; a male voice called out. Since I wasn&#x2019;t new, I ignored him. But I did glance slightly to the left to see who it was. Asa Griffith. I almost paused. He was good friends with Ryker and Nash Lee. Ryker I didn&#x2019;t care about, but Nash . . . let&#x2019;s just say that my hurt and anger because of him were what kept me going all summer. When it was so hot I thought I&#x2019;d melt, but I walked anyway. When I really wanted some hot-from-the-oven cookies, but I ate an apple instead. It had been revenge. Admitting it wasn&#x2019;t something that I was proud of, but it was the truth. I hated Nash Lee. But that hate had driven me to lose weight.<br> <br>Before I could think too long and hard about it, I stopped and turned to Asa Griffith. He was attractive, popular, and would be the Lawton Lions star running back now that West Ashby had graduated. Asa gave me a flirty grin I had never seen before. Guys like Asa didn&#x2019;t smile at girls like me. Or they hadn&#x2019;t. I realized how shallow they were now that I was thin. My plan for revenge may be something ugly. But so was the way they treated girls due to their weight. Inside I was the same. No, that wasn&#x2019;t true; inside I was angrier now.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know how to flirt. I was one to shrink near a corner. So I just stared at him. Waiting to see what would come out of his mouth next.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asa,&#x201d; he said with a nod as he closed the distance between us. &#x201c;You just move here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I replied. This question I had prepared for. I was going to enjoy it. Seeing the looks on their faces when they found out they&#x2019;d known me for years.<br> <br>He was still smiling, but he looked confused. &#x201c;Homeschooled?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Asa. We had Literature together last year. Economics the year before that. In fifth grade you tripped me in the hallway, and my books went everywhere. It was an accident. At least I assumed it was since you helped me pick up my books.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was more fun than I realized it would be. He stood there frowning. I wondered if he even knew my name. It only fueled the fire inside me. My revenge seemed justified.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asa,&#x201d; a familiar voice called out, then a pause. I turned my head and met his gaze head on. He wasn&#x2019;t the one I hated. He had never noticed me before. He&#x2019;d not been someone I expected to be better than that. Nash had been. But Ryker Lee had been there. He had said the words. Made the joke. The one that had cut deep enough to change me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, hello,&#x201d; Ryker Lee said with a drawl. Then as he got closer to me, I saw the confusion in his eyes. Slowly that turned to clarity. He recognized me. &#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>I let him take in my transformation. As he let out a low whistle that I found insulting, Asa said &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; He was still confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tallulah, right?&#x201d; Ryker said when his eyes stopped gawking at my body and found my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow&#x201d; was all he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tallulah.&#x201d; Asa said my name as if it were familiar, but he just couldn&#x2019;t place it.<br> <br>&#x201c;The summer was good to you,&#x201d; Ryker finally said, a slow smile spreading across his face.<br> <br>I wanted to say that I had in fact worn a bathing suit. But I held that close. He didn&#x2019;t need to know I&#x2019;d heard him. I also didn&#x2019;t want to hear his apologies.<br> <br>&#x201c;Likewise,&#x201d; I said, although I gave him a forced smile. &#x201c;Have a good day,&#x201d; I added, then walked away. That was done. My first conversation with those close to Nash. As much as I didn&#x2019;t want to talk to them. Ryker had never spoken to me before. Why should I speak to him now? But I had to. My plan was to be accepted into Nash&#x2019;s world and then completely ignore him. Embarrass him in front of his friends. Let him see how it felt. Then, when I was satisfied, I&#x2019;d walk away from all of that crowd. Find a path that fit me and be happy. But not yet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; Asa called out.<br> <br>I stopped walking and glanced back at him. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a senior, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was all I could do not to roll my eyes. I simply nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your first class?&#x201d;<br> <br>Seriously? It was this easy? He didn&#x2019;t know me. Had no idea if I was intelligent, had a sense of humor, had any ambition in life. But he saw how I looked in this short skirt, and that was all it took. I had his complete attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trig,&#x201d; I told him.<br> <br>His eyebrows shot up. &#x201c;Gorgeous and smart. We&#x2019;ve got that one together. I&#x2019;ll walk with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>We had been in advanced classes together since ninth grade. Something he didn&#x2019;t recall. But I did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I agreed, then saw Ryker watching me. I gave him a smile and little wave that I assumed was flirty before walking toward the entrance with Asa.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a hard time believing we&#x2019;ve been in school together since elementary and I don&#x2019;t remember you. Although your name is familiar.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a smart boy, you&#x2019;d think he would realize how admitting he didn&#x2019;t remember me made him seem like a jerk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt you notice fat girls.&#x201d; The distaste in my tone was unavoidable. I could only take so much.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fat?&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned my head until my eyes met his. &#x201c;No, Asa, not now. Not anymore. But the Tallulah you don&#x2019;t remember was fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Slowly I could see the recognition in his eyes. They grew wider, and then his mouth dropped open slightly. Maybe he did remember the fat girl in the corner. My face was thin now, but it had all the same features. If he&#x2019;d ever taken the time to look at me then, he&#x2019;d see that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You gave me your notes last year when I missed class for a week with the flu,&#x201d; he whispered. Like he was too amazed to talk in his normal tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stared at me then. I wondered how many other memories of me he was recalling. I let him stare. Remember the girl I once was, because that girl was nicer. Kinder.

Tulsa, Oklahoma, added me to its census that evening; my parents picked up another tax exemption.<br><br>Since I've been old enough to remember, adventure and excitement have always captured my attention. Westerns and war movies were my favorites, and I loved it when the Earps beat the Clantons to the draw at the OK Corral, and the Marines mowed down the Japanese human-wave assaults on Guadalcanal. It was the way of the warrior--the way it was supposed to be done.<br><br>I still remember Hopalong Cassidy mounted on the back of his snow-white stallion, Topper, as he passed by me during a parade down the streets of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Because I got to see him in person, he was always one of my favorites.<br><br>There were also Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Davy Crockett, and Daniel Boone. They were all special to me--they were my heroes. John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Alan Ladd, and Randolph Scott were my favorite tough guys. Crockett, Boone, and Jim Bowie fascinated me, causing me to feel that I had been shortchanged at birth. I convinced myself that I should have been born during the early frontier days. Wearing my coonskin cap and carrying a rifle like Crockett's old Betsy, I would have wreaked havoc on the frontier.<br><br>For hours at a time, my childhood friends and I played cowboys and Indians; then we would switch to being combat soldiers during World War II, using sticks as weapons if guns were not available. Many battles raged daily through our neighborhood, and the good guys always won. It was about then that the series Combat was running on television, and it commanded most of my attention. I especially liked the theme song.<br><br>At an early age, my first BB gun was a constant companion, and then, on my sixth birthday, I was given the ultimate weapon--a single-shot .22-caliber rifle. After drilling me with an extended course in gun safety and showing me how to care for it, my dad taught me how to shoot. We spent many hours rabbit and squirrel hunting along the Arkansas River. Those times hold some of my fondest early memories.<br><br>My parents divorced when I was almost seven, and both remarried shortly afterward. I stayed with my mom and my stepdad, and when I turned eight, they moved us to Irving, Texas. We stayed there for six years before relocating again to Hurst, Texas, where I attended L.D. Bell High School.<br><br>Summer-league baseball and football occupied much of my time during my high school years. In addition, I swam, played a lot of golf, and fished. All those activities were fun, but my real love was hunting. I could hardly wait until the seasons opened in the fall. Quail, dove, rabbit, squirrel, and deer were my favorites.<br><br>After I graduated from high school, my career path seemed unclear. I considered coaching or being a government hunter or game warden, but nothing really seemed very appealing. I wanted to work outdoors, but everything I looked at seemed to lack the adventure and excitement I craved. I enrolled at North Texas State University at Denton in the fall. However, I suffered a thigh injury while playing touch football that put me on crutches for a while. The temporary disability didn't do much for my motivation, and after struggling to make it through the semester, I decided to return home and enlist in the army.<br><br>Right after I got back home, Steve Gerber, a friend from high school, came home from Vietnam on a thirty-day extension leave. He was in Special Forces (SF), and he was going back for six more months. After spending some quality time talking with him and reading a brochure about SF, I decided that it was just the challenge I had been looking for. Steve gave me a ride on the back of his motorcycle, and the two of us headed to Arlington, Texas, to talk to an army recruiter. It didn't take him long to convince me that the army was where I belonged. I enlisted for Special Forces and departed for basic combat training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in October 1967.<br><br>I was in excellent physical condition when I reported for basic. That, and the fact that I had a very positive attitude, enabled me to come within one point of being the outstanding trainee of my basic-training cycle. Still, it got me a promotion to private E-2. After graduation, I was transferred to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to attend Morse code school, a critical MOS (military occupational specialty), for Special Forces.<br><br>Two weeks before graduation, my dad was killed in an automobile accident. I went home on emergency leave to attend the funeral. By the time I returned to Fort Huachuca, my class had already graduated. Fortunately, one only had to send and receive thirteen words a minute to graduate from the course. Since I was already sending and receiving twenty-three words per minute, they gave me my certificate immediately.<br><br>Fort Benning, Georgia, was my next stop. I had already made the decision to attend Airborne school as soon as I finished Morse code classes. The very thought of being a paratrooper excited me though I had always been afraid of heights. I arrived a few days before our class actually started, so I had the distinct pleasure of serving on KP, an experience not worth telling about. It was not an enjoyable episode.<br><br>Airborne training officially began on a Monday with ground week, mental harassment, and physical conditioning, which meant run, run, run, everywhere we went. Obviously, it was an attempt by the cadre to run the less committed trainees into quitting. A few did. We also practiced our PLFs (parachute landing falls) to make sure that if the fall didn't kill us, we could survive the landing. We also practiced exiting the aircraft properly. This was important because a bad exit could result in a number of major problems when a chute opens, any of which could result in a crash-and-burn arrival on the drop zone 1,250 feet below. The commands of "stand up," "hook up," and "shuffle to the door" were drummed into our heads over and over again.<br><br>Week two, tower week, consisted of training on the 34-foot and 250-foot towers. The first simulated the shock of the parachute opening, and the second gave us a taste of falling under a full canopy. They separated the men from the boys and gave us a sample of what we would be experiencing during an actual jump.<br><br>Finally, jump week was upon us, the climax to the previous two weeks' training. That was the week that would see us making five actual parachute jumps, the number needed to qualify for the coveted jump wings of a paratrooper. Quite a few guys washed out of the program during that critical week in our training, and our jump class was significantly smaller as we approached graduation day. What a rush it was to stand in the door and fling myself up and out into the prop blast! When the chute opened seconds later and I looked up to see that oversize canopy fully deployed, there was no thrill like it anywhere on the face of the earth.<br><br>When we graduated after our fifth jump, Colonel Welch, the Airborne School commandant, congratulated us and welcomed us into the elite airborne brotherhood. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I had been promoted to the rank of private first class (E-3) right after graduation.<br><br>I took the Special Forces battery test, a four-hour written exam, shortly after completing Jump School. I was informed the next day that my scores were acceptable and that I was off to Special Forces Training Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.<br><br>Fort Bragg was only a short distance out of Fayetteville, North Carolina, and was also the home of the 82d Airborne Division and the XVIII Airborne Corps. When we arrived, we were bused out to Smoke Bomb Hill and assigned to Training Group. I was excited that I would soon be able to wear the green beret and crest emblazoned with the motto, De Oppresso Liber--We Liberate the Oppressed, but we had to complete three separate and very demanding phases of training before graduating and getting our group beret flash.<br><br>Phase I was a mixture of physical conditioning, classroom training, and a survival exercise that involved a parachute deployment into a guerrilla-held area. The classroom training was interesting and germane to what we would be doing in the field. After completing the round of instruction, we were ready for the coming exercise.<br><br>The survival exercise was to be a lesson in military tactics, conditioning, and endurance. We would begin the exercise by making a night parachute jump into a small drop zone. While being pursued by aggressor forces for several days, we would be forced to live off the land while navigating through thick, heavily forested terrain. We would have to practice patrol techniques, immediate-action drills, and establish ambushes as we had been taught in the classroom phase of our training.<br><br>During the jump, my stick was the last one to exit the aircraft into the pitch-black night. Everything went well until I was about treetop high, when I was caught by a strong crosswind that turned my chute and hurtled me into the ground. I landed hard, flat on my back in the middle of an asphalt road with a full load of equipment on. The impact nearly knocked me unconscious. When I was finally able to gather my wits about me, I discovered that I suffered a numbing paralysis. My back was throbbing, and the pain was unbearable.<br><br>An ambulance arrived to evacuate me to Womack Army Hospital, where doctors diagnosed my injury as a lower lumbar back strain. They ordered several days of bed rest, followed by a period of physical therapy. My world was shattered soon afterward when I was informed that my dream of being SF-qualified was very much in doubt. If I could ever jump again, I would surely have to be recycled back through Phase I to start over again. However, my back continued to bother me even though I had decided to drive on.<br><br>Word soon filtered down to Training Group that 5th Special Forces Group needed more personnel in Vietnam. Several of us volunteered to terminate Training Group and go directly to Vietnam in hopes of getting into 5th Group. After a thirty-day leave, I flew out of Dallas's Love Field for Oakland, California, on the first leg of the journey to Vietnam.<br><br>Flying on a commercial airplane for over twenty hours gave me plenty of time to reflect on my past and consider my future. Having just turned twenty years old a little over a month before, I had nearly two decades to look back over.<br><br>Family, school, sports, friends, mistakes, and achievements flooded through my mind as I stared out the aircraft window. Below us was the bright blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean. I saw an occasional ship plying the surface en route to some distant port. Inside the plane, everyone seemed lost in thoughts of home and what lay before us. It was hard to focus on anything but that strange, distant land called "Vietnam." What would the future hold for me? Would I survive the next year? After a period of time, I got tired of trying to answer the unanswerable and drifted off to sleep.<br><br>We landed at Tan Son Nhut Airport near Saigon. When I stepped off the aircraft, I was greeted by a terrific blast of heat that made me gasp. The strange smell of diesel fumes and a mixture of other noxious gases nearly overwhelmed me.<br><br>We boarded a string of olive-drab military buses for the short but scenic ride out to Bien Hoa, and then on to Long Binh, where we were turned over to the confusion and frustration of the 90th Replacement Center. We were awed by the sights and sounds of urban and rural South Vietnam. Poverty, perversity, pain, and suffering were evident wherever we looked. A country at war is a terrible thing to witness. But it was something we would get used to as we became a part of its scenery and participants in its fratricide. Guard towers, sandbagged bunkers, roadblocks, concertina wire, military vehicles and personnel were everywhere. If there was any doubt before that we were in a war zone, it was quickly erased by the martial aura surrounding South Vietnam's capital city. I developed a sudden lump in my throat that was not there when we landed a short time before. It was all quite sobering to a twenty-year-old soldier whose combat experience had been limited to books, movies, and childhood play. Vietnam was the real thing. I wondered what kind of mess I had gotten myself into. I knew that I would likely find out in the very near future.<br><br>The first night in country, we received a special welcome from the locals outside the perimeter. Mortar rounds began falling inside the compound. Monstrous explosions filled the night as shouts of "Incoming!" echoed through the night. Everyone ran for the nearest bunkers, where we cringed fearfully in the humid darkness, hoping that we would live to see the next day. Welcome to Vietnam!<br><br>The next day, we received orders assigning us to our units. The sergeant who called my name announced that I was being assigned to Company F, 52d Infantry (LRP), 1st Infantry Division. I listened proudly to the muffled comments of those around me, and the long, negative sighs of pity. I had already discovered that Special Forces was no longer in need of additional personnel so I had volunteered for duty with the long-range patrol company, or LRPs. It was what I had trained for . . . hoped for . . . it was what I wanted. It was small-team warfare at its finest. Recon, ambushes, pilot rescues, POW snatches--all the things I had dreamed of were finally coming true.<br><br>Each infantry division and independent brigade in Vietnam had a LRP unit attached to it to serve as the eyes and ears of the parent unit. There were even two additional LRP companies, one each attached to I Field Force and II Field Force. The LRP units were made up of volunteers, for the most part Airborne-qualified, who had already earned a reputation in country for daring, resourcefulness, and problems with conventional military authority.<br><br>My orders assigned me to report to a base camp out in III Corps at Lai Khe. It was the home of the Big Red One, the legendary 1st Infantry Division. I boarded a C-130 Hercules transport and flew out to Lai Khe the next day. When we landed, I discovered that Lai Khe lay in the middle of a huge rubber plantation, surrounded by an endless expanse of single-, double-, and triple-canopy jungle. Lai Khe had been nicknamed "Rocket City" for a very good reason; the enemy used it as the terminal point for hundreds of rocket and mortar attacks directed to demoralize and destroy American forces in the area.</p><h2>For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet</h2><p><p>Olivier Messiaen (1908'1992) was one of the great composers of the twentieth century. The premiere of the French composer's Quartet for the End of Time on January 15, 1941 at -4 degrees Fahrenheit in Stalag VIII A, a Nazi prison camp, has been called one of the great stories of twentieth-century music. A devout Catholic with an interest in mysticism and the supernatural, Messiaen was also a poet and an accomplished amateur ornithologist. He mixed sounds as a painter mixes colors, associating specific shades with certain modes and chords.</p><p>This book is the first comprehensive history of the composition and premiere of the Quartet for the End of Time. Based on testimonies by the musicians and their families, witnesses to the premiere, former prisoners, and on documents from Stalag VIII A, For the End of Time examines the events that led to the Quartet's composition, the experiences of the musicians in the camp, the contradictory accounts, the composer's interpretive preferences, and the musicians'problems in execution and how they affected the premiere and subsequent performances. Rebecca Rischin explores the musicians'life in the prison camp, their relationships with each other and with the German camp officials, and their intriguing fortunes before and after the momentous premiere.</p><p>For the End of Time is distinguished by Rischin's extensive interviews and intimate correspondence with camp survivors who witnessed the Quartet's premiere and members of the Messiaen circle, including the cellist Etienne Pasquier and the violinist Jean Le Boulaire, relatives of the clarinetist Henri Akoka, and Messiaen's widow, Yvonne Loriod. The book is generously illustrated with photographs of the musicians, press releases from the premiere, autographs, letters, and pen-and-ink drawings of the camp's layout. Included are wartime photos of the camp and its prisoners along with present-day views of the camp site, which Rischin visited in 1995.</p></p><p><p>Rebecca Rischin is Associate Professor of Music at Ohio University in Athens. Her research for this book was aided by a Harriet Hale Woolley Scholarship for study in Paris, awarded in 1993 to only two other American artists and musicians. Rischin is an award-winning clarinetist who performs regularly throughout the United States and Europe.</p>The writing and first performance of French composer Olivier Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time, in a German POW camp in the bitter winter of 1941, is one of the great stories of 20th century music. Ohio University music professor Rischin has gone to heroic lengths to separate the facts from the legends that have grown up about it. Some of these legends, as she demonstrates, were encouraged by the composer himself, who would tell interviewers the whole work was composed at Stalag VIIIA in Silesia, that its form was dictated by the instrumentalists available there (piano, cello, violin and clarinet), that the cellist played with only three strings and that there was a rapt audience of thousands. In fact, Messiaen (1908-1992) had written the work's celebrated clarinet solo, "Abyss of the Birds," some time before with clarinetist Henri Akoka's participation; cellist Etienne Pasquier had his full quota of strings; and the camp building could hold at most 400 or so. Rischin tracked down the elderly Pasquier and violinist Jean La Boulaire (who lived his postwar life as an actor) and also talked to Messiaen's widow and Akoka's surviving family. Oddly, none of them had been interviewed about the occasion, which made the work Messiaen's most celebrated. These interviews show a remarkable picture of life at a desperate time-and of how the German authorities were anxious to show their civilized side to the French. The players come off better than the deeply religious, aloof, rather ethereal Messiaen, who seems to have been so otherworldly as to recoil from life's messiness. This is a fascinating, and finally believable, account of a remarkable occasion.

Doctors rely on the conclusions it publishes, and most do not have the time to look beyond abstracts to examine methodology or question assumptions. Many of its pronouncements are conveyed by the media to a mass audience, which is likely to take them as authoritative. But is this trust entirely warranted?<br><br> Theodore Dalrymple, a doctor retired from practice, turned a critical eye upon a full year of the <i>Journal</i>, alert to dubious premises and to what is left unsaid. In <i>False Positive</i>, he demonstrates that many of the papers it publishes reach conclusions that are not only flawed, but <i>obviously</i> flawed. He exposes errors of reasoning and conspicuous omissions apparently undetected by the editors. In some cases, there is reason to suspect actual corruption.<br><br> When the <i>Journal</i> takes on social questions, its perspective is solidly politically correct. Practically no debate on social issues appears in the printed version, and highly debatable points of view go unchallenged. The <i>Journal</i> reads as if there were only one possible point of view, though the American medical profession (to say nothing of the extensive foreign readership) cannot possibly be in total agreement with the stances taken in its pages. It is thus more megaphone than sounding board. <br><br> There is indeed much in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> that deserves praise and admiration. But this book should encourage the general reader to take a constructively critical view of medical news and to be wary of the latest medical doctrines.</p><p>Theodore Dalrymple was born in London in 1949. He retired as a full-time doctor in 2005. He is the author of many books, notably <i>Life at the Bottom</i> (Ivan Dee) and <i>Romancing Opiates</i> (Encounter), which challenges the notion that heroin addiction is a bona fide disease.&#x201c;<i>False Positive</i> examines the central paradox of modern medicine that while it must, by necessity, deal in reliable knowledge, it is nonetheless permeated by error generating numerous contradictory claims about the ubiquitous threats to health in our everyday lives and the value, or otherwise of the latest medical advances. Theodore Dalrymple's investigation of a year's worth of the most authoritative and influential of all medical journals may not seem the most beguiling of subjects but allows him to illuminate with great clarity and much wit how wishful thinking, the selective presentation of data, unacknowledged personal bias and the dead hand of political correctness can obscure and distort the truth. Forthright, thought provoking, and profound, this is the most revealing book on the current intellectual state of medicine one could hope for.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;James Le Fanu, author of <i>The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine</i></p><h2>At the Water&#39;s Edge : Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea</h2><p><b>Everybody Out of the Pond</b> <br> <i>At the Water's Edge</i> will change the way you think about your place in the world. The awesome journey of life's transformation from the first microbes 4 billion years ago to <i>Homo sapiens</i> today is an epic that we are only now beginning to grasp. Magnificent and bizarre, it is the story of how we got here, what we left behind, and what we brought with us. <br> We all know about evolution, but it still seems absurd that our ancestors were fish. Darwin's idea of natural selection was the key to solving generation-to-generation evolution -- microevolution -- but it could only point us toward a complete explanation, still to come, of the engines of macroevolution, the transformation of body shapes across millions of years. Now, drawing on the latest fossil discoveries and breakthrough scientific analysis, Carl Zimmer reveals how macroevolution works. Escorting us along the trail of discovery up to the current dramatic research in paleontology, ecology, genetics, and embryology, Zimmer shows how scientists today are unveiling the secrets of life that biologists struggled with two centuries ago. <br> In this book, you will find a dazzling, brash literary talent and a rigorous scientific sensibility gracefully brought together. Carl Zimmer provides a comprehensive, lucid, and authoritative answer to the mystery of how nature actually made itself.</p><p><b>Carl Zimmer</b> writes for <i>National Geographic, Natural History, Science, Nature, Audubon,</i> and <i>National Wildlife.</i> A former senior editor at <i>Discover,</i> he has won the American Institute of Biological Sciences Media Award and the Evert Clark Media Award. <i>At the Water's Edge</i> is his first book.

It was roughly the size and shape of a rolling pin, with a knife-edged tail, with fins like whiskers. Its eyes were the dark heads of pins, and its lips were full and sinful. The man stood tall and a little stooped, and although in 1839 he was only thirty-five, he had the kind of brown-eyed glare on which old failed prophets usually have a monopoly. He had seen the skin, guts, and bones of hundreds of animals that no Englishman had seen before, but few had irritated him more than this one.<br><br>His name was Richard Owen -- not yet Sir Richard, but on his way there. He had grown up in Lancaster, and in boyhood his prospects had not seemed so good. His father, a ruined merchant, had died in the West Indies when Richard was five. A lazy, impudent boy, he joined the navy at fourteen, working as a surgeon's apprentice, but after the end of the War of 1812 peacetime offered little hope of a career, and so he returned to Scotland. He had loved heraldry, and it may have been while drawing unicorns and griffins that he first became interested in animal form. Again employed as a surgeon's apprentice, he began collecting skulls, beginning with dogs, cats, deer, and mice. But he wanted more bones. For a time he worked for a surgeon who performed autopsies on the dead prisoners at Hadrian's Tower. On a cold day in January the two of them paid a call to the prison, and after the autopsy the surgeon left Owen to clean up. This time Owen did not pack all the instruments. He left a few blades alongside the opened corpse, and handing the guard some coins, he told him that he needed to come back later. There was some extra business to attend to before the coffin was screwed shut.<br><br>He returned in the frozen moonlight up the icy hill to the tower, bringing with him a strong brown paper bag. He nodded to the guard, who nodded back, and he climbed up the stairs to the autopsy room and shut the door as he went in. Before long he opened the door again, his paper bag full. He passed the guard again and told him that the inmate was ready. As he left the tower and began to walk back down the hill, his mind was filled with thoughts of facial angles and osseous tissues. The more he thought about the work he would enjoy at the surgery that night, the faster he walked. Suddenly his feet kicked out from under him. The bag swung away as he fell on the ice, its contents rolling free. He ran after it, down toward a cottage at the bottom of the hill, but he was too late. A woman inside heard a thump at the base of her front door. She opened it and before her was a disheveled, owl-eyed boy trying to stuff a freshly severed head into a bag. He ran with it all the way to the surgery, her screams flying after him.<br><br>Owen went to the University of Edinburgh at age twenty, but he soon outstripped their classes -- within a year he was traveling to London with letters of introduction from his private tutors and got a position as a surgeon at a hospital. To be a doctor in London in the 1820s was as much a political act as a profession. The medical establishment -- including the city's hospitals and medical journals -- was controlled by physicians who generally had Tory sympathies. Allied with the physicians were the surgeons who performed dissections and held a lower position on the social ladder. Opposed to them were the general practitioners who were educated at small private colleges and were of a more radical egalitarian bent. Set on reforming medicine, they lambasted the elitism of physicians and surgeons wherever they could, in renegade medical journals or newspapers or Parliament. They fought fiercely for access to the library and museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. A famous British surgeon named John Hunter had amassed thousands of books and a collection of thirteen thousand pickled animals, disembodied hearts, limbs, bladders, spines, and other materials that laid out the patterns of anatomy, but after his death in 1793, the collection languished for years. The government bought it and entrusted it to the Royal College of Surgeons on the understanding that they would publish catalogs, keep a lecture series, and open the museum and library to the public. But for over twenty years the college had let in only its own, and the GPs crowed loudly until Parliament took notice. The college agreed to let licensed doctors in and to draw up an official catalog.<br><br>Owen was hired to assist on the job, and when his superior died, the work became his alone. It was a labor that would keep him occupied for decades. At the same time he struggled to advance his own career as an anatomist, lecturing to medical students and winning the right to dissect the animals that died at the London zoo. It wasn't out of the ordinary to walk into Owen's house and find a freshly dead rhino parked in the hallway.<br><br>In 1830 a sixty-one-year-old French baron, ailing yet imperious, came to the Hunterian Museum. Because Owen was the only one there who spoke French, it fell to him to tour the man around. His name was Georges Cuvier -- a professor at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and to Owen the sun in the sky. Like Owen, Cuvier had started as a shabby-genteel outsider, a German Protestant who wandered the hills around Montb�liard as a boy, picking plants that he would take home. There he would classify them according to the scheme of the eighteenth-century naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who had constructed the hierarchy of species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Cuvier was supposed to become a bureaucrat in the Prussian government after he graduated, but he emerged out of the Stuttgart Academy among a huge bolus of aspiring bureaucrats. A job came his way only when a friend returned home to Montb�liard after finishing a stint as a tutor to a family in Normandy. He arranged for Cuvier to take his place.<br><br>In Normandy Cuvier was treated more like a family servant than a tutor. He tried to console himself by thinking about the tour of Europe he was going to take his student on, and by studying whatever life he could find -- the plants in the town garden, a private store of exotic fish, another of oriental birds. But before his tour could begin, the French Revolution overran Paris and spread out into the countryside. His family fled to a village on the coast where Cuvier, now twenty-one, fell into almost complete solitude. He would walk the beach alone, collecting the animals that washed ashore, picking through the guts of skates that the fishermen would sell him. He wrote learned letters to the leading zoologists in Paris, and his reputation as a homegrown naturalist increased. After the revolution cooled, Cuvier visited Paris, where he stunned the scientists at the new National Museum with the knowledge he had taught himself. They were desperate for skilled help and hired him instantly. He was only twenty-three when he joined, but then again the man who invited him, a professor of zoology named Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, was only twenty-one. "Come to Paris," Geoffroy wrote to him. "Come play among us the role of another legislator of natural history." It was a parliament founded by boys.<br><br>By the age of thirty Cuvier had invented modern paleontology. People had collected fossils for centuries, yet even in the 1500s Europeans thought of them not as real skeletons but as some of the many forms a rock could take: some became emeralds, other became imitations of snail shells. Gradually naturalists recognized too many similarities between these stones and the bones of living animals, mineralogists realized how bone could be transmuted to rock, and the traditional view of fossils began to buckle. By the 1700s naturalists had found bones of everything from elephants to giant spiraled shellfish in the earth. Noah's flood, many of them decided, must have cast them to the tops of mountains.<br><br>Cuvier studied fossils as seriously as living animals. Bringing a steady flow of bones to Paris from the limestone quarries outside the city, he prised them free of the rock and found among them elephants that were different from the species alive today. He could only conclude that they belonged to a species that was gone from the world. No one had seriously thought that an entire species could become extinct, but within a few years Cuvier had found rhino-sized sloths and tapirs that had also vanished. He realized that a single flood couldn't have washed away all the creatures he was finding: their fossils disappeared at different points in geological time, demonstrating that life had shuddered over and over again with violent revolutions. Each time a new kind of life had somehow come into existence.<br><br>Whenever Cuvier looked at an animal, extinct or alive, he was overwhelmed by how all the parts fit together in a whole -- a single, unified organism. A bird was dedicated to flight in every aspect, from the fan of its tail feathers to its enormous lungs to its thin hollow bones. Substitute a bone from a barracuda into a bird skeleton, and the whole creature would be ruined. It was this dedication to function that could account for how different animals were similar to one another and could be fit into Linnaeus's classification. Since function dictated form, animals that functioned similarly looked alike. He divided animals into four major groups, based on how their nervous system -- to Cuvier the essence of an animal -- was laid out. Vertebrates had a brain and a spinal cord, the mollusks had a brain but no cord, others had barely a nervous system to speak of, and still others had systems that radiated out from a central nerve cluster. With such different architecture, each group could share no connection with the others, and the only reason that animals fell into a given category was that they happened to function in similar ways.<br><br>It's no wonder then that Cuvier scorned the ideas of another scientist at the museum named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who argued that species actually changed over time -- that they evolved. When Lamarck looked at fossil mollusks he found that he could arrange some of them into a smoothly graded sequence through successive layers of rock. He claimed that in coping with a changing environment, a generation of creatures would undergo changes that they would pass on to their own offspring. Cuvier would have none of this transmutation. When Napoleon came home from Egypt with plundered mummies of cats and ibises thousands of years old, Cuvier compared them to living specimens and could find no significant difference. To him, life had a deeper order than Lamarckian evolution could allow.<br><br>By the time Cuvier came to London and met young Owen, he had become a hero to France. "Is not Cuvier the greatest poet of our century?" asked Balzac. "Lord Byron reproduces mortal throes in verse, but our immortal naturalist has reconstructed worlds from a whitened bone. Cuvier is a poet by mere numbers. He stirs the void with no artificially magic utterance; he scoops out a fragment of gypsum, discovers a print-mark and cries out 'Behold!' -- and lo, the trees are animalized, death becomes life, the world unfolds."<br><br>He was admired by the English as well, particularly by the sort of English who ran the College of Surgeons. The agitating general practitioners in London liked the idea of transmutating species and thought that humanity should strive upward, while the upper crust of scientific society preferred the idea that God had created fixed species on earth out of nothing. Their intricate designs were proof of his existence as much as a watch is proof of a watchmaker. And just as every animal had its place, higher or lower, in nature, people had their own place in society. Cuvier was therefore most welcome at the Hunterian Museum, and Owen must have managed to make a good impression on him during their short tour, because Cuvier invited him to Paris the next year.<br><br>In Paris Owen spent mornings in Cuvier's collections searching for inspiration for how to organize the mess waiting for him back at the Hunterian Museum. The rest of his time he spent as a dandy, taking in the opera and violoncello lessons, with Saturday nights reserved for Cuvier's soir�es -- the only time when the stony man would abandon politics and anatomy. Owen also went to meetings of the Academy of Sciences, where people were still buzzing about a debate that Cuvier, after coming back from London, had entered into with his old mentor Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.<br><br>Geoffroy and Cuvier had drifted far apart over the years. Cuvier liked to stick to facts, to avoid the sickened dreams of theory that weren't solidly embedded in the details of real zoology. Geoffroy meanwhile was enchanted by the work of German biologists and philosophers of the day, Romantics who hoped to find a hidden unity to all creation. He had never been much impressed by the classes and orders and kingdoms that scientists like Linnaeus and Cuvier depended on to categorize life. To Geoffroy they seemed arbitrary, since no division was absolute. Things that might make one cluster of animals unique could often be shown to be just the transformed structures of other beasts. A rhino's horn, he showed, was nothing more than a packed clump of hair. And if each species was perfectly created to fit its function, why had God left so many careless mistakes? Why does an ostrich have a wishbone, whose only function in birds is to help them fly?<br><br>Geoffroy conceived instead of a wild German hallucination: that you could transform any animal, be it a dog, an ant, or a squid, into any other. The transformation might be painful -- to see the underlying similarity between a duck and a squid, you'd have to bend the duck's back into a horseshoe. Eventually Geoffroy decided that these transformations were not hypothetical -- they were a sign that evolution had changed old species into new ones. Perhaps, he suggested, the change in an environment changed the way embryos developed. Freaks might be the start of new species. Geoffroy knew that his theory went against everything that Cuvier held dear, and for ten years he tried to lure Cuvier into debate. Finally, after he gave a lecture showing how he could bend the back of a vertebrate and end up with an invertebrate, Cuvier accepted the challenge. Cuvier had become frustrated by how his own students were being seduced away by the German song of unity, how political revolutionaries were coming into vogue again, and decided that this was the time to stand against it.<br><br>In a series of lectures, Cuvier used forty years of anatomy to mock Geoffroy's somersaults of bone and muscle. Cuvier was sure afterward that he had won the debates, but the real results weren't so clear. Owen was a case in point: listening to biologists argue the opposing views at the academy, he decided that Cuvier was right, but he still jotted down questions to ask himself.

If it isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;well, perhaps you could ask this helpful saint to lend a hand.</i></p><p>The Tale of St. Fiacre</p><p>Fiacre lived in the seventh century. He was raised in an Irish monastery, where he learned to use healing herbs. He wanted to be a hermit, but his skill and knowledge brought people to him, so he went to France in search of solitude, taking up residence in a cave near a spring. He needed a garden (who doesn&#x2019;t?) so he asked a nearby bishop, St. Faro of Meaux, for land. The bishop gave him as much garden space as he could plow in a day. The next morning, it is said, Fiacre chose his spot and began to walk around it, dragging his spade behind him. Magically, wherever his spade touched, trees toppled, bushes were uprooted, the soil was turned over, and the rocks were plucked out. The local folk, frightened, called it sorcery, but the bishop declared Fiacre&#x2019;s garden a miracle. (Personally, I suspect that the bishop had some gardening work of his own that needed to be done.) Fiacre&#x2019;s garden, always in bloom and always beautifully tended, became a place of pilgrimage. His healing herbs were eagerly sought, and his culinary herbs were used to flavor food that was offered to the poor.</p><p><b>To invite blessings to your garden</b> you might purchase a small statue of this gardener&#x2019;s saint and put it in a quiet corner, where you can enjoy the meditative silence Fiacre sought in his own garden. Surround it with such healing herbs as sage, thyme, mint, fennel, dill, and St. John&#x2019;s wort, herbs that Fiacre would have known and used.</p><p><i>The growing of the first few herbs is the discovery of a whole new world of garden pleasure and human meaning, but it is when a gardener has tried a few, liked them and been liked by them and would go on that the full adventure begins. &#x2013;Henry Beston, Herbs and the Earth</i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Finding New Ground</h2><p>Conflict is at the heart of life. It impacts relationships of the heart, the home, the community, and at work. Most flee from it, some embrace it, but few learn how to master conflict and productively transform it into a consensus. Author Robert Chadwick is one of those few. For over forty years, he has been helping individuals and communities experience and learn how to best address their personal, interpersonal, and intergroup conflicts. In Finding New Ground, he shares his insights and a process from his storied career as a conflict resolution manager. He shows readers how to apply these insights and the process in their own life situations, finding new ground in their relationships, creating a path to a way of being that changes everyone around them. The author's purpose is to help you experience, learn, and understand a process for addressing and resolving conflicts and building consensus with 100 percent agreement. The book informs readers on how people define conflict, their feelings about it, what causes it, the arenas in which it occurs, and why conflict must always be confronted. It demonstrates why people avoid resolving their conflicts. It demonstrates what a true consensus is and why it is always possible. A central section of the book explores an intergroup conflict that erupts over the use of a fictional river basin in the American West. This fictional account is based on Chadwick&#x2019;s real-life experience, providing a context for learning about the process in a real way. You are part of the story as a co-facilitator with the author. Throughout this story the actual words and statements of previous workshop participants are used to create a sense of reality. Through this story, the reader will vicariously experience and understand the complexity of this simple consensus building process and learn how to apply the skills and tools for finding new ground. These include the use of the circle, listening with respect, empowering yourself and others, creating a sense of equity, and fostering a sense of community. This real life situation shows how a conflict-riddled group moved from divisiveness and animosity to consensus while they crafted a short term purpose, a long term vision, articulated shared beliefs, and developed a common strategic plan. His model of consensus building has worked across different cultures. It has been deployed in countries like India, Thailand, Canada, Hong Kong, Russia, and Belgium. His workshop participants cut a wide swath through contemporary society, ranging from loggers and librarians to police officers, educators, and professional managers. His methods have been used by people from a range of ages, from kindergarten students to senior citizens in their ninth decade of life. Chadwick&#x2019;s book presents a proven transformative model for addressing contemporary conflicts and building consensus. Individuals, families, community, churches, and businesses all stand to learn a lot from his unique approach to finding new ground. His method is grounded in reality, and through building consensus allows participants to move beyond the hostility of conflict to fostering the creation of civility and community.</p><p>Robert Chadwick (Bob) is inter-nationally recognized for his special abilities to bring differing groups together to communicate and develop common solutions. He has pioneered the development of consensus building techniques which foster creative solutions to old conflicts. With 29 years experience as a professional, manager, executive and internal organizational development consultant in a major Federal Agency, and 25 years as a private consultant, Bob has accumulated a comprehensive education and experience in managerial and conflict resolution strategies. He has a proven ability to help groups and communities successfully in mission development, organizational change, team building, labor negotiations, and conflict resolution. His management development and consensus activities have involved people at all levels of the public and private sectors. Bob has worked throughout the United States and Internationally on conflicts surrounding agriculture, technology transfer, natural resources, scarce resources allocation, education and rapid social and political change. He has developed skills and techniques that are easily learned and are directly applicable to any management decision or conflict situation. They can be applied to personal, interpersonal and intergroup conflicts, especially those relating to rapid change, a perception of scarcity, power struggles, managing diversity, and fostering civility. These techniques are applied in a format in which the stakeholders learn how to seek consensus while negotiating and resolving their conflict. He creates an environment in which the participants develop a belief that consensus is possible and they are willing to take the risk to make it happen. He has facilitated consensus solutions in over 1,500 situations involving more than 30,000 people in this country and internationally. He is conversant with the issues and concerns of public agency and private industry managers, educators, professionals, elected officials from Federal to local levels, environmentalists, union members, loggers, miners, ranchers, housewives, professionals, American Indians and other cultural groups, attorneys, and others on contemporary issues. The process has been applied in numerous countries, including India, Thailand, Egypt, Singapore, Canada, England, Belgium, Hong Kong. Bob lives with his wife in Terrebonne, OR. They have 8 children, 23 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren. This book is written for them.</p><h2>Gimme Something Better: The Profound, Progressive, and Occasionally Pointless History of Bay Area Punk from Dead Kennedys to Green Day</h2><p><b>An oral history of the modern punk-revival?s West Coast Birthplace</b><br><br>Outside of New York and London, California?s Bay Area claims the oldest continuous punk-rock scene in the world. <i>Gimme Something Better</i> brings this outrageous and influential punk scene to life, from the notorious final performance of the Sex Pistols, to Jello Biafra?s bid for mayor, the rise of <i>Maximum RocknRoll</i> magazine, and the East Bay pop-punk sound that sold millions around the globe.

Now he continues his travels through the spirit world in this astonishing book, leading us into the heart of one of the greatest mysteries of existence.<br><br>Dr. Wesselman's inspiring quest began with a dramatic encounter on the island of Hawaii. Though he had feared his connection to Nainoa, a kahuna initiate and fellow mystic traveler, would be severed when he moved to San Diego, Wesselman would continue to merge minds with Nainoa. Over the next five years, the true purpose of their profound yet cryptic contact took shape. Wesselman had gained access to some inner doorway, putting him in the presence of a transcendent life force and intelligence. On the threshold of a dazzling new understanding of nature, he was a shaman in training, an initiate into the sacred, secret healing powers of the spirit world.<br><br>This remarkable book gives us an unprecedented glimpse into the origin and the destiny of our species. Hank Wesselman has brought back from his extraordinary travels an extraordinary message: the keys to personal power and to the healing of all humankind.</p><p><b>Hank Wesselman</b>&nbsp;is a professional anthropologist who has conducted expeditionary fieldwork throughout the world independently and with Don Johanson and Richard Leakey. He has taught courses in anthropology for the University of California at San Diego and the University of Hawaii at Hilo. He and his family divide their time between Northern California, where he teaches anthropology and lectures on shamanism and mysticism at American River College and Sierra College, and Hawaii, where they own and work a small farm.<b>Reentry</b><br><br>My family and I departed from our farm in Hawai'i in the summer of 1989. We took up residence in a suburb of San Diego for the next academic year while I served as a visiting lecturer in anthropology for the local branch of the University of California.<br><br>When our children entered school in the fall, my wife, Jill, joined an all-women team of doctors, nurses, and health-care professionals, working as a physical therapist. We juggled our schedules to meet the needs of our children, our days revolving around school dropoffs and pickups, teaching classes and commuting on freeways, shopping in supermarkets and visits to the zoo, professional seminars and PTA meetings. It seemed as if we were constantly rushing, never quite completing one responsibility before the next would be upon us.<br><br>I reacted to being back in California with strong feelings of foreboding. The prosperity of the Reagan years had abruptly come to an end, and millions of people were unemployed, with millions more caught in the crunch of escalating medical and property costs. The newspapers were filled with accounts of yesterday's disasters and stories of dishonesty, fiscal mismanagement, violent crime, and abuse. The population of southern California had grown exponentially. Formerly open expanses of countryside were now filled with subdivisions and shopping malls, and the traffic was stifling. It was quite a change from the quiet life on our farm in rural, upcountry Hawai'i.<br><br>In the midst of all this, the visionary adventures I had experienced in Kona were always there, right behind my eyes. In the evenings, with the children in bed and the next day's lectures prepared, much time was spent contemplating what I had learned.<br><br>First and foremost, I had discovered the presence of some sort of inner doorway within myself, one that opened periodically, giving me glimpses into levels of reality and experience I had not thought possible. The opening was usually accompanied by visual hallucinations, spots of light, labyrinthine lines, zigzags, vortexes, and grids that some cognitive investigators have called "phosphenes." There was almost always a buzzing, roaring rush of sound accompanied by overwhelming bodily sensations of force or power that rendered me paralyzed for the duration of the experience. The intensity of the experience could have been quite frightening were it not for its exquisite nature. I now understood why the word ecstasy is associated with religious trance.<br><br>Something else of note had happened during our time in Hawai'i. I had become the kahu, the honored caretaker, of a <i>pohaku kupua</i>, a "spirit stone" that I found in the waves below the tideline at Kealakekua Bay, where I swam daily with my family. On the day that I found it, I recognized it with shock, for I had seen it in a vision more than a year before in the possession of the chief of Nainoa's settlement. The stone took up residence in a rock garden near my front door, and in time I began to suspect that it was part of the causality for the connection between me and Nainoa, for the stone had been there, unseen among the other rocks at the interface of the beach and the bay, when my visionary connections with Nainoa had commenced. Toward the end of my days in Kona, I received a clear impression that it wished to accompany me to the mainland of America--an intention in keeping with its formal name, Kapohaku'ki'ihele, the stone that travels.<br><br>When the shipping container containing our household goods arrived in San Diego, I located the crate containing the stone and unpacked it first. The dark boulder looked rather dry, and I wondered uneasily if it were still "alive" after its trip in the hold of a ship. It had always stood outside in our garden in Kona, so we placed it under a scraggly fig tree in the backyard of our rental, a postage-stamp-sized piece of sun-baked clay that had been neglected by the former tenants.<br><br>Interestingly, as soon as the stone was in place, the whole yard seemed to come to life. The grass staged a dramatic comeback, several untended clumps of Cape honeysuckle erupted into clouds of orange-red flowers, and a large dracaena burst into fragrant bloom. A stand of sickly-looking banana trees actually began to produce bananas. It was the fig tree, however, that underwent the greatest change. Once the stone was placed beneath it, the tree started to throw out leaves and fruit at a truly impressive rate that continued unabated even throughout the coldest part of the next winter, when the tree dropped its leaves and frost killed some of my bonsai. During the year and a half that the stone remained under the tree, the flow of figs never ceased.<br>Despite the stone's presence, I had no new altered-state experiences for almost a year, perhaps because I was so busy with ordinary reality concerns. I taught several anthropology classes at the university, including one focused on religion and magic in the lives of traditional peoples. My daily office hour continually lengthened as students dropped in to discuss aspects of this course, and I found myself listening to young people tell me their own stories of startling, life-changing experiences. Several had met the "shadow," the dark, monolithic spirit that both Nainoa and I had encountered at the onset of our visionary adventures. Many had had d�j� vu experiences, clairvoyant or telepathic perceptions not regarded as valid or "real" by Western culture at large. When I counted up the number of individuals who had had some sort of mystic experience, I was amazed. More than 10 percent of the students fell into this category.<br><br>Many had also been badly damaged by life and were emotionally scarred. Within myself, I felt a growing sense of compassion, and I began to wonder how I could help them. Through my experiences in Hawai'i, I had become aware of the connection that exists between knowledge and power. However, it's one thing to teach a class about shamanism and magic. It's quite another to practice it.<br><br>In Western society, we tend to think of a magician as one who performs incredible illusions before amazed audiences. In tribal societies, magic involves accessing the realm of the sacred in order to persuade, control, or influence supernatural power to assist in manifesting something in the ordinary, everyday world. What is manifested is determined largely by the intentions and personality of the practitioner as well as the needs of the client or community. As I listened to my students, I was very much aware that I had no training, nor any tradition from which to operate in this capacity.<br><br>When the semester came to an end, I decided that part of the final examination would include ritual in which I would expose my students to the sound of the rattle for the first time. Many traditional people say that the rattle helps them connect with mystical power and that the sharp, dry sound is like a telephone call to the spirit world. But I knew this only from my reading when I gathered the class for the final meeting.<br><br>We pushed the desks back against the wall and sat on the floor in a circle. I drew the shades, darkening the room, and lit a single candle in the cleared center, a minimalist ritual I remembered from a shamanic workshop I had attended years before with the anthropologist Michael Harner. The rattle I used was a commercial object made of plastic that belonged to my children, but it had a nice sharp sound. I instructed my students to close their eyes and listen to the sound of the rattle, to just let their conscious awareness follow it and pay attention to anything that might come up.<br><br>As the dry, rhythmic whisper filled the classroom, I followed the traditional custom of addressing the spirits of the four directions to ask for protection and support--for myself and for all those gathered. I closed my eyes and felt my consciousness shift sideways as the familiar, dreamy state descended. Abruptly the feelings of power invaded my body, and I was momentarily staggered. As I wondered with some concern if I was going to go into a full, paralytic trance, the sensations stabilized at a level in which I could continue to rattle. I suddenly felt a familiar presence. I cracked open my eyes and got quite a shock.<br><br>There, against the darkness of the blackboard, a curious swirl of sparkling lights appeared. Within it, a cluster of spots took form and coalesced into a shape I knew well. It was my old ally the leopard man, an imaginary friend from childhood who had reentered my life during the Harner workshop. The leopard man had functioned as a spirit helper to both myself and Nainoa during my visionary episodes, and I suspected that he had played a pivotal role in bringing the two of us together.<br><br>I quickly glanced around the classroom to discern if anyone else could see him, but my students were all sitting quietly, their eyes closed, as I had instructed. I shot another look at my feline ally. He was standing bipedally, like a human, and seemed roughly as tall as me. His rosettes swirled with light as he alternately merged into and separated out of the darkness surrounding him. This was the first time I had seen him since leaving the islands, so I gathered my wits and offered a Buddhist bow while I endeavored to continue rattling.<br><br>I then mentally explained what I was doing and asked him for assistance. In response, he did something quite catlike. He closed his luminous eyes in that distinct squint that cats express when they are feeling good. His eyes closed, then opened slightly, then closed again, conveying ease. I glanced at his paws, or were they hands and feet? No, they were definitely paws, and his claws were retracted, a good sign.<br><br>As I walked around the circle, rattling above and around each student's head, the leopard man's eyes followed, witnessing the ritual, testifying to the beginning of my transformation from academic teacher in the Western sense into . . . what? I suddenly realized that a tribal person would say I was functioning as a medicine man.<br><br>As I concluded the ritual and the rattle subsided into silence, my awareness shifted, and the leopard man evaporated, dissolving into the swirl of light very much in the same way he had arrived. I sat down at my place in the circle feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Fortunately, the students then took over and made their final presentations. Throughout, the feelings of power remained, just below the surface. Both the scientist and the mystic within me were most impressed.<br>When the year's teaching was over, I suddenly found myself with large blocks of free time. In the mornings, with Jill at work and the children at school, I began to sit under the fig tree with the spirit stone whenever I paused to have a cup of tea, and my attention came to rest on my "field notes" from Hawai'i. One day I sat down at the computer and began to put together the first full-fledged version of <b>Spiritwalker</b>. Perhaps it was coincidence, but that night, an hour before dawn, something awakened me.<br><br>As I lay in bed in the darkness, I heard a coyote howl from the hillsides beyond the edges of the suburb. I looked out the window at the starry sky, and memories of the future moved through my mind. I felt quite awake, and as I watched the thoughts that flew through my mind like birds, I came to a decision. I formed a strongly focused intention to journey again to Nainoa.<br><br>I waited, but nothing unusual happened. I focused again. Nothing. After a while I decided to cancel the attempt. My attention shifted and I thought about the fact that I had failed to find a job for the coming year. I felt feelings of extreme disappointment mixed with fear. What was I to do? I had a family to support. Was I in the process of losing my profession as an anthropologist?<br><br>Long moments of soul searching followed, but no immediate solutions were apparent as I tossed and turned, unable to get back to sleep. Jill awoke and we talked in the dark until almost dawn and then made quick, intense love. Our lives were filled with work and responsibilities now, and rare were the moments we had alone together.<br><br>I felt very relaxed in passion's aftermath and looked out the window once again at the stars. I began to drop off to sleep when the sensations of power appeared abruptly within me, sweeping up my back and into my brain. I shut my eyes tightly, but the stars remained, points of light dancing in the dark. The exquisite paralysis commenced, accompanied by the familiar soaring feelings of bliss and the roaring rush of sound. I had been waiting for this for a year.<br><br>I formed an image in my mind of the spirit stone in the backyard and invoked its help. The sensations increased enormously. Flashes of light coalesced into bright spots that became lines as my eyes looked this way and that. As the brilliant grid took form within and around the lines, the transparent, flickering arc appeared and began to open, blinding me and flooding me with ecstatic force. As I struggled with the effort of breathing, feelings of outward movement began. The journey had begun.<br><br>There was no fear. This was familiar now, a known experience. I focused strongly upon my destination as my body shook and the roaring in my ears increased. I plummeted into the arc in a flash of fiery sensation; then the sound and the visuals abruptly diminished to nothing as the zone of darkness and silence was traversed. The smell of wood smoke and furs heralded the restoration of my sensory perception.<br><br>I had once again achieved contact with Nainoa. My excitement was immediately countered by an emotion I had not expected. I was flooded by a sense of deep and personal grief.</p><h2>The Library of Ragtime and Early Blues Piano (Library of Series)</h2><p>A spiral bound collection of the world&#39;s finest ragtime and blues piano classics.

Her father's response was a warning to steer clear of him; he told Bo: "Curiosity scribbled the cat." Nonetheless, Fuller began her strange friendship with the man she calls K, a white African and veteran of the Rhodesian war. With the same fiercely beautiful prose that won her acclaim for <b>Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight</b>, Fuller here recounts her friendship with K.<p>K is, seemingly, a man of contradictions: tattooed, battle scarred, and weathered by farm work, he is a lion of a man, feral and bulletproof. Yet he is also a born-again Christian, given to weeping when he recollects his failed romantic life, and more than anything else welling up inside with memories of battle. For his war, like all wars, was a brutal one, marked by racial strife, jungle battles, unimaginable tortures, and the murdering of innocent civilians&#x2014;and K, like all the veterans of the war, has blood on his hands.</p><p>Driven by K's memories, Fuller and K decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way&#x2014;by traveling from Zambia through Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. It is a strange journey into the past, one marked at once by somber reflections and odd humor and featuring characters such as Mapenga, a fellow veteran who lives with his pet lion on a little island in the middle of a lake and is known to cope with his personal demons by refusing to speak for days on end. What results from Fuller's journey is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of men who have killed, mutilated, tortured, and scrambled to survive during wartime and who now must attempt to live with their past and live past their sins. In these men, too, we get a glimpse of life in Africa, a land that besets its creatures with pests, plagues, and natural disasters, making the people there at once more hardened and more vulnerable than elsewhere.</p><p><b>Scribbling the Cat</b> is an engrossing and haunting look at war, Africa, and the lines of sanity.</p></p><p>Thomas Wolfe's trusted axiom about not being able to go home again gets a compelling spin through the African veldt in Alexandra Fuller's <i>Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier</i>. Fuller (<i>Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight : An African Childhood</i>) journeys through modern Zambia, to battlefields in Zimbabwe and Mozambique with the scarred veteran of the Rhodesian Wars she identifies only as "K." Intrigued by the mysterious neighbor of her parent's Zambian fish farm and further enticed by her father's warning that "curiosity scribbled the cat" ("scribbling" is Afrikaans slang for "killing"), Fuller embarks on a journey that covers as much cratered psychic landscape as it does African bush country. Though she and "K" are both African by family roots rather than blood, she quickly discovers that 30 years of civil war have scarred them--and the indigenous peoples they encounter--in markedly different ways. "K" is a figure of monumental tragedy, a decent man torn by war-fueled rage, a failed marriage, and painful memories of an only son lost to tropical disease. His adopted Christianity offers him only partial absolution, and Fuller details his gut-wrenching confessions of quarter-century old atrocities with compassion and rare insight. Her prose liberally salted with a rich, melange of Afrikaans and local Shona slang, Fuller nonetheless struggles with a narrative whose turns are often unexpected, yet driven by humanity. There's a clear sense that the author's fitful journey into the past with "K" has opened as many wounds as it has healed, and spawned more questions than it has answered. It's that discomfort and frustration that often reinforces the honesty of her prose--and reinforces Thomas Wolfe's adage yet again. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>Alexandra Fuller was born in England in 1969 and in 1972 she moved with her family to a farm in Rhodesia. After that country&#x2019;s civil war in 1981, the Fullers moved first to Malawi, then to Zambia. Fuller received a B.A. from Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. She is the author of <i>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood</i>, a national bestseller, a <i>New York Times </i> Notable Book of 2002, and a finalist for the Guardian First Book Award, and <i>Scribbling the Cat</i>, winner of the 2005 Ulysses Award for Art of Reportage.

Created by two of today&#x2019;s wittiest, most imaginative minds, <i>The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z! </i>is a sheer delight from A to Z. In twenty-six alliterative couplets, Steve Martin conjures up much more than mere apples and zebras. Instead we meet Horace the hare, whose hairdo hides hunchbacks, and Ollie the owl, who owed Owen an oboe. Roz Chast contributes the perfect visual settings for Martin&#x2019;s zany two-liners. Her instantly recognizable drawings are packed with humorous touches both broad and subtle. <br><br>Each rereading&#x2014;and there will be many&#x2014;delivers new delights and discoveries. There, hidden behind Bad Baby Bubbleducks, is a framed picture of a beatnik holding balloons; and the letter C finds clunky Clarissa all clingy and clueless adrift in a landscape cluttered with images ranging from a curiously comfortable clown to Chuck&#x2019;s Chili stand. A smart, laugh-inducing introduction to the alphabet for young children, <i>The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z!</i> will also enchant adults with its matchless mix of the sophisticated and the silly.</p><p>STEVE MARTIN is a celebrated writer, actor, and performer. His film credits include <i>The Jerk</i>, <i>Father of the Bride,</i> and <i>The Spanish Prisoner, </i>as well as <i>Roxanne</i>, <i>L.A.

Updates since the highly acclaimed 2000 edition include information on the first Native American in space and the Canadian Parliament's endorsement of the UN "Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples," and more color maps and photographs. The volume is divided into several broad subject areas, such as "Ancient Native Peoples," "Native Lifeways," "Indian Wars," "Native Land Cessions and a Changing Way of Life," and "Contemporary Native North Americans." The subject divisions follow a chronological pattern and explore Native history across the continent, in no way marginalizing Central America or Canada. The exemplary informational content is complemented by numerous maps and photographs, in both color and black and white. Numerous access points include an extensive map list and a series of appendixes, such as the "Chronology of Native Prehistory and History," "Native Nations in the United States (with Languages and Locations)," "Contemporary Canadian First Nations," and "Major Native Place-Names in the United States and Canada." The bibliography is extensive. This work stands out due to its scope and the attention given to the Canadian Native experience. The use of the word "Indian" in the title may be problematic, especially for Canadian librarians, but Waldman's preface outlines the variety of terms used for North America's first peoples and explains that they are all used throughout the book, where applicable. This visually appealing resource will be an excellent addition, even if libraries own the previous edition.&#x2014;<i>Robyn Walker, Elgin Court Public School, St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada</i> END</p><h2>The Campbells: The Origins of the Clan Campbell and Their Place in History (Scottish Clan Mini-Book)</h2><p>With roots buried deep in the ancient soil of Scotland, the Campbells were for centuries at the forefront of the drama that is the nation&#39;s frequently turbulent history.

His smile was his best asset, brilliant and shining in a face made up of otherwise regular features. He had hair the color of wet sand and cloudy blue-green eyes; both attractive, but when paired with the smile...breathtaking.<br><br>"Very good answer," he said.<br><br>He held out his hand. When I took it, he pulled me closer, step by hesitant step, until he could lean close and whisper in my ear. His hot breath gusted along my skin, and I shivered. "Do you like licorice?"<br><br>I did, and I do, and he tugged me around the corner to reach inside a bin filled with small black rectangles. It had a label with a picture of a kangaroo on the front.<br><br>"Try this." He lifted a piece to my lips and I opened for him although the sign clearly said No Samples. "It's from Australia."<br><br>The licorice smoothed on my tongue. Soft, fragrant, sticky in a way that made me run my tongue along my teeth. I tasted his fingers from where they'd brushed my lips. He smiled.<br><br>"I know a little place," he said, and I let him take me there.<br>The Slaughtered Lamb. A gruesome name for a nice little faux-British pub tucked down an alley in the center of downtown Harrisburg. Compared to the trendy dance clubs and upscale restaurants that had revitalized the area, the Lamb seemed out of place and all the more delightful for it.<br><br>He sat us at the bar, away from the college students singing karaoke in the corner. The stools wobbled, and I had to hold tight to the bar. I ordered a margarita.<br><br>"No." The shake of his head had me raising a brow. "You want whiskey."<br><br>"I've never had whiskey."<br><br>"A virgin." On another man the comment would have come off smarmy, earned a roll of the eyes and an automatic addition to the "not with James Dean's prick" file.<br><br>On him, it worked.<br><br>"A virgin," I agreed, the word tasting unfamiliar on my tongue as though I hadn't used it in a very long time.<br><br>He ordered us both shots of Jameson Irish Whiskey, and he drank his back as one should do with shots, in one gulp. I am no stranger to drinking, even if I'd never had whiskey, and I matched him without a grimace. There's a reason it's also known as firewater, but after the initial burn the taste of it spread across my tongue and reminded me of the smell of burning leaves. Cozy. Warm. A little romantic, even.<br><br>His gaze brightened. "I like the way you put that down the back of your throat."<br><br>I was instantly, immediately, insanely aroused.<br><br>"Another?" said the 'tender.<br><br>"Another," my companion agreed. To me he said, "Very good."<br><br>The compliment pleased me, and I wasn't sure why impressing him had become so important.<br><br>We drank there for a while, and the whiskey hit me harder than I thought it would. Or perhaps the company made me giddy enough to giggle at his subtle but charming observations about the people around us.<br><br>The woman in the business suit in the corner was an off-duty call girl. The man in the leather jacket, a mortician. My companion wove stories about everyone around us including our good-natured bartender, whom he said had the look of a retired gumdrop farmer.<br><br>"Gumdrops don't come from farms." I leaned forward to touch his tie, which featured a pattern that upon first glance appeared to be the normal sort of dots and crosses many men wore. I, however, had noticed the dots and crosses were tiny skulls and crossbones.<br><br>"No?" He seemed disappointed I wouldn't play along.<br><br>"No." I tugged his tie and looked up into the blue-green eyes that had begun vying with his smile for best feature. "They're harvested in the wild."<br><br>He guffawed, tilting his head back with the force of it. I envied him the free and easy way he gave in to the impulse to laugh. I'd have been afraid people would stare.<br><br>"And you," he said at last. His gaze pinned me, held me in place. "What are you?"<br><br>"Gumdrop poacher," I whispered through whiskey-numb lips.<br><br>He reached to twirl a strand of hair that had fallen free from my long French braid. "You don't look that dangerous, to me."<br><br>We looked at each other, two strangers, and shared a smile, and I thought how long it had been since I'd done that. "Want to walk me home?"<br><br>He did.<br><br>He didn't attempt to make love to me that night, which didn't surprise me. He didn't try to fuck me, either, which did. He didn't even kiss me, though I hesitated before putting my keys in the door and smiled and chatted with him before saying good-night.<br><br>He hadn't asked for my name. Not even my number. Just left me buzzing from whiskey on my doorstep. I watched him walk down the street, jingling the change in his pocket. He faded into the darkness between the streetlamps, and then I went inside.<br><br>I thought about him the next morning in the shower while I washed the scent of smoke from my hair. I thought about him while I shaved my legs, my pits, the curling dark hair between my legs. When I brushed my teeth I caught sight of my face in the mirror and tried to imagine seeing my eyes as he had.<br><br>Blue with flecks of white and gold visible upon closer observation. A feature many men praised, perhaps because telling a woman she has pretty eyes is a safe way of judging whether they can next move on to putting a hand on her thigh. He hadn't mentioned them. He hadn't, actually, complimented me on anything other than the way I'd drunk the whiskey.<br><br>I thought about him as I dressed for work. Plain white panties, comfortable in cut and fabric. Matching bra, a hint of lace, enough to make it pretty but designed to support my breasts rather than flaunt them. A black skirt cut just above the knee. A white blouse with buttons. Black and white, as always, to make the choices easier and because something about the pure simplicity of black and white soothes me.<br><br>I thought about him on the ride to work, my headphones tucked inside my ears to discourage random conversation from strangers. The shield of modern times. The ride was no longer than it ever had been, nor shorter, and I counted the stops the way I always did and gave the bus driver the same smile.<br><br>"Have a good day, Miss Kavanagh."<br><br>"Thanks, Bill."<br><br>I thought of him, too, as I climbed the cement steps to my office and pushed through the doors precisely five minutes before I was due in my office.<br><br>"You're late today," said Harvey Willard, the security guard. "An entire minute."<br><br>"Blame the bus," I told him with a grin I knew would make him blush, though the blame was not upon the bus but upon my distracted gait that had made me slow.<br><br>Up the elevator, down the hall, through my door, to my desk. Not one thing was different, but everything had changed. Not even the columns of numbers in front of me could wrest my mind from the puzzle he'd presented.<br><br>I didn't know his name. Hadn't given him mine. I'd thought it would be easy, two strangers looking to fill a mutual need. A standard seduction. One that didn't need names to complicate it.<br><br>I didn't like men knowing my name, anyway. It gave them a sense of power over me they didn't deserve, as if by gasping out my name when they jerked and spasmed they could cement the moment in place and time. If I had to give a name, I gave them a false one, and when they shouted it out in come-hoarse voices it never failed to make me smile.<br><br>I wasn't smiling today. I was distracted, disgruntled, discombobulated...I'd have been disenchanted if I'd ever been enchanted to begin with.<br><br>I worked the problem in my mind like I'd figure a calculation. Separate the equations, decipher the individual components, add the pieces that made sense and divide them by the parts that didn't. By lunchtime I still hadn't been able to relegate him to a memory.<br><br>"Hot date last night?" Marcy Peters, she of the big hair and tiny skirts, asked. Marcy is the sort of woman who will always refer to herself as a girl, who wears white pumps with too-tight jeans, whose blouses always show a little too much cleavage.<br><br>She poured herself another cup of coffee. I had tea. We sat at the small lunchroom table and peeled open sandwiches delivered from the deli, hers tuna and mine, as usual, turkey on wheat.<br><br>"As always" came my reply, and we laughed, two women bound in friendship not from qualities in common or mutual interests but because our alliance forms the cage that protects us from the sharks with whom we work.<br><br>Marcy fends off the sharks with a blunt and unassuming, forthright presentation of her femininity. Of herself as woman all-powerful, all-intriguing, allencompassing. She is blond and buxom and not above using her attributes to get what she wants.<br><br>I prefer a more discreet approach.<br><br>Marcy laughed at my response because the Elle Kavanagh she knows does not go on dates, hot or otherwise. The Elle Kavanagh of her acquaintance, junior vice president of corporate accounting, makes the cliche of the lady-librarian-with-spectacles-and-bun look like Lady Godiva.<br><br>Marcy doesn't know anything about me, or my life outside the walls of Triple Smith and Brown.<br><br>"You hear the news about the Flynn account?" This was Marcy's idea of lunchtime conversation. Gossip about other employees.<br><br>"No," I said to appease her and because she always did manage to dig up the best stories.<br><br>"Mr. Flynn's secretary sent the wrong files over to Bob, who's handling the account, right?"<br><br>"All right."<br><br>Glee danced in Marcy's eyes. "Apparently, she e-mailed Mr. Flynn's private expense account, not the corporate one."<br><br>"It has to get better."<br><br>"Apparently, Mr. Flynn likes to keep track of how many hundred-dollar hookers and bootleg cigars he buys!" She wriggled in her seat.<br><br>"Bad news for Mr. Flynn's secretary, I guess."<br><br>Marcy grinned. "She's been blowing Bob on the side. He didn't tell Mr. Flynn."<br><br>"Bob Hoover?" That was unexpected news.<br><br>"Yeah. Can you believe it?"<br><br>"I guess I can believe anything of anybody," I told her honestly. "Most people are far less discriminating about who they take to bed than you'd think."<br><br>"Oh, really?" She gave me a ferrety look of interest. "And you'd know this because.?"<br><br>"Pure conjecture." I pushed away from the table and threw away my trash.<br><br>Marcy didn't look disappointed, only more intrigued.<br><br>"Uh-huh."<br><br>I gave her a sweet and bland smile, and left her alone to meditate on my mysterious sex life.<br><br>The fact is, people <em>are</em> far less discriminating in who they fuck than anyone wants to admit. Appearance, intelligence, a sense of humor, wealth, power...not everyone has these qualities, and fewer have more than one. But here's the truth. Fat, ugly and stupid people get laid, too, the media just doesn't report on it like they do when the lovers are gorgeous film stars. Men don't need to be clobbered over the head with the sight of your tits to know you're looking for action. Even pent-up librarian types can get fucked with their panties around their ankles and a brick wall scraping bloody welts on their backs.<br><br>At least, this one can.<br><br>Or at least I'd been able to three years ago, which was the last time I'd gone out looking. I hadn't been looking for action at Sweet Heaven, merely jonesing for chocolate. So why, then, had I let him take me away? Why had I asked him to walk me home and been so disappointed when he left me on the doorstep with nothing but a wave?<br><br>That I hadn't been looking to find someone that day only exacerbated my private torture. If I'd found him in a bar instead of Sweet Heaven, if my hair had been loose about my shoulders, if my blouse had been unbuttoned, would he have asked to come inside my door? Come inside my body? Would he have kissed me on the stoop, his hands slipping around my waist and pulling me against him tight? I would never know.<br><br>I thought of him all that day and all the next, and the wanting of him grew and grew in my mind like pouring water into a vase filled with stones. Thinking of him consumed my waking moments and seeped into my dreams, leading to sweaty nights amongst tangled sheets.<br><br>I studied my face incessantly, wondering what he had seen that day to take me from the candy store and to the pub, but not to bed. Had I failed somehow? Had I said some wrong thing, revealed some flaw, laughed too loudly or not quickly enough at his humor?<br><br>I knew I was obsessing. That's what I did. Turned things over and over in my brain to pick them apart from every angle. Analyzed and calculated and pondered.<br><br>I could not forget the way his breath smelled when he leaned over to whisper in my ear, "Do you like licorice?"<br><br>I could not forget the warmth of his hand on mine when he congratulated me for downing that first shot of whiskey.<br><br>I could not forget the flash of his blue-green eyes or the small but perfect cleft in his chin or the faint freckles on the bridge of his nose and forehead or his voice and laugh, the slow deep honey of it that had made me want to lean against him and rub myself on him the way cats do, purring.<br><br>The last time I picked up a man in a bar and let him take me home, he'd ejaculated all over my skirt and cried beer-scented tears all over my face. Then he'd called me names and demanded I pay him back for the drinks he'd bought me. It had been one last bad encounter in a string of them. Boys who didn't know what to do with their pricks, older men who thought two seconds of fingering counted as foreplay, sweet-faced lads who turned into abusive bastards the moment the doors locked behind them.<br><br>Celibacy had become the better option. A challenge I set myself that became habit. The day I'd met him in Sweet Heaven it had been three years, two months, a week and three days since I'd had sex.<br><br>Now, with thoughts of him on my mind, that nameless stranger, I couldn't stop thinking of sex. A man I passed on the street could catch my gaze and my cunt would clench like fingers closing on a flower. My nipples rubbed with constant friction against my bras. My panties tugged incessantly at my clit, urging me to stroke that small button over and over, no matter the place or the time or the circumstance.<br><br>I was horny.<br><br></p><h2>The Uncommon Appeal of Clouds (Isabel Dalhousie Series)</h2><p><b><b>ISABEL DALHOUSIE - Book 9<br></b><br><b>Nothing captures the charm of Edinburgh like the bestselling Isabel Dalhousie series of novels featuring the insatiably curious philosopher and woman detective.&nbsp; Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction&#x2019;s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life&#x2019;s questions, large and small.</b><br></b><br>Isabel Dalhousie, the Edinburgh philosopher and amateur sleuth, answers an unexpected appeal from wealthy art collector Duncan Munrowe.

And then she added, &#x201c;Srinivasa Ramanujan.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>From his side of the kitchen table, Jamie, her husband of one year, lover of more than four, looked up quizzically. &#x201c;Mozart, of course, but Srini&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He attempted the name, but decided he could not manage it and trailed off into a liquid melt of vees and sibilants. Indian names, mellifluous sounding though so many of them may be, can defeat even those with a musical ear. Jamie was accustomed to the stocky sound of Scottish names, redolent as they were of an altogether more forbidding and windswept landscape&#x2014;those Macdonalds and Macgregors, Macleans and Mackays.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Srinivasa Ramanujan,&#x201d; Isabel repeated. &#x201c;He was, like Mozart, a child prodigy. A genius.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I used to be so discouraged by Mozart,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;I suspect he has that effect on any child who&#x2019;s interested in music. You hear about how he was composing complicated pieces at the age of five, or whatever, and you think, I&#x2019;m already twelve&#x2014;which is ancient by comparison&#x2014;and I haven&#x2019;t written anything. And it makes you ask yourself whether there&#x2019;s much point in making all that effort.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;But what about this Srinivasa?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He was a brilliant mathematician back in his day,&#x201d; said Isabel. She made a gesture that indicated the earlier part of the twentieth century&#x2014;or at least did so to her; to Jamie it was no more than a vague movement of the hand. &#x201c;He died when he was barely into his forties.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Like Mozart. What age was he when he died? Thirty-five, wasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel nodded. &#x201c;Which prompts the usual thoughts of what might have been.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of music lost,&#x201d; said Jamie. He had noticed that people invariably said something like that when the shortness of Mozart&#x2019;s life was mentioned. What he could have done if he had lived another ten years, another twenty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the symphonies, the operas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel reached for her teacup. &#x201c;Yes. And in the case of Ramanujan, of problems unsolved. But that&#x2019;s not what interests me. I&#x2019;ve been thinking of the parents and of their role in their children&#x2019;s lives. Mozart&#x2019;s father spent a very large part of his time on his children&#x2019;s musical education. Teaching him to compose, taking him on those long tours. A pushy father, if ever there was one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And Srinivasa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what about his parents?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel smiled. &#x201c;He had a mother to contend with. She doted on him. She said that he was the special gift of the household&#x2019;s private god. She was a mathematician too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So the best chance of being a prodigy is to have an obsessive parent?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel agreed, but only to an extent. She believed in nurture, but she gave more weight to nature. &#x201c;You have to have the right genes in the first place. Mozart&#x2019;s sister had the same upbringing as he did, with the same musical attention. She became a very competent performer but she was not a musical genius.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie looked up at the ceiling. &#x201c;Imagine being Mozart&#x2019;s sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, imagine. That bit&#x2014;the genius bit&#x2014;has to be there somewhere in the brain. It&#x2019;s probably a matter of brain design, of neuro-anatomy. Mozart had it; his sister clearly didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie called that the wiring. Badness, he thought, was usually a question of faulty wiring; Isabel was not so sure. &#x201c;I read about a rather interesting case of mathematical genius,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Nabokov.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The author? The one who wrote Lolita?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Nabokov was a mathematical prodigy as a child. He could do elaborate calculations in his head, within seconds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie was interested. Musicians were often competent or even more than competent mathematicians&#x2014;the wiring, perhaps, was similar. At school his best subject, after music, had been mathematics, and yet he had always had to approach it slowly, even ploddingly. &#x201c;How do they do it? I just can&#x2019;t im-agine how it&#x2019;s possible. Do they have to think it through, or does the answer come to them automatically, just like that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel said that she thought they had their tricks&#x2014;systems that allowed them to make seemingly instantaneous calculations, just as people with exceptional memories had their mnemonics. &#x201c;Some of it, though, comes to them instantly because they just know it.&#x201d; She took a sip of her iced tea, and looked at Jamie. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t have to think, would you, if I asked you what number multiplied by itself gives you nine.&#x201d; She smiled encouragingly. &#x201c;Would you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Three.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to work that out?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie replied that the answer had simply been there. He had, in fact, seen the figure 3.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then perhaps it&#x2019;s the same for them,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;The work is done at a subconscious level&#x2014;the conscious mind doesn&#x2019;t even know it&#x2019;s being done.&#x201d; She returned to Nabokov. &#x201c;He was capable of amazing calculations and then suddenly he became ill with a very high fever. When he recovered his mathematical ability had gone. Just like that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The fever affected the brain?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Burned out the wiring, as you might say.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How strange.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Very.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They looked at one another wordlessly. Each knew that the other was thinking of their young son, Charlie, now an energetic three-and-three-quarter-year-old; energetic, but currently asleep in his bedroom on that summer morning that was already growing hot. An uncharacteristic heat wave had descended on Edinburgh and the east of Scotland. It brought with it not only a summer languor, but the scent of the country into the town&#x2014;cut hay, baked hillsides, heather that was soon to flower purple, the sea at Cramond&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel broke the silence. &#x201c;So what exactly did he say?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie&#x2019;s reply was hesitant. &#x201c;I think it was something like this. You know those bricks of his&#x2014;the yellow ones?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did. They had on them bright pictures of ducks engaged in various pursuits&#x2014;driving a train, drinking tea, flying in small biplanes&#x2014;and Charlie adored them, even to the extent of secreting one of them under his pillow at night. One could love anything as a child, she thought; a teddy bear, a security blanket, a yellow brick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There were twenty bricks,&#x201d; Jamie went on. &#x201c;We counted them. And he counted with me, all the way up to twenty&#x2014;which is impressive enough, if you ask me. But then I said, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s take half of them away.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t know why I said it&#x2014;I hadn&#x2019;t imagined that he&#x2019;d be able to cope with the concept of halves. But you know what he said? He said, &#x2018;Ten.&#x2019; Just like that. He said, &#x2018;Ten.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>There was more. &#x201c;Then I said, &#x2018;All right, let&#x2019;s put eight bricks here and take half of those away.&#x2019; And he said, &#x2018;Four.&#x2019; He didn&#x2019;t even seem to think about it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel was listening intently. Had Charlie ever done anything similar for her? She did not think so. He had asked some perceptive questions, though, and one or two of them had startled her. The other day, apropos of nothing, he had suddenly said, &#x201c;Brother Fox know something? Know not a dog?&#x201d; She had been momentarily taken aback but had replied, &#x201c;I think he knows that.&#x201d; Then she had quizzed him as to why he had asked her this, but his attention had been caught by something else and he had simply said, &#x201c;Foxes and dogs,&#x201d; before moving on to another, quite different subject. For Isabel&#x2019;s part, she had been left with a question that had become increasingly intriguing the more she thought about it. Brother Fox presumably instinctively understood that dogs were not part of his world, but did that mean that he had some concept of foxdom? Probably not.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So then I tried something different,&#x201d; Jamie continued. &#x201c;I took nine bricks and asked him to put them in three piles that were all the same. And you know what he said? He said, &#x2018;Three.&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Three bricks, here, here, here.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Division. It sounds impressive, but is it all that unusual?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie shrugged. &#x201c;I asked them at the nursery school. They said children of four should be able to add and count up to five. They said nothing about division, or multiplication. Just counting.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Or the piano,&#x201d; added Isabel.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Or that. I told them that he can do a C major scale and they said something about his hands still being quite small and it must be difficult for that reason. They didn&#x2019;t seem all that interested.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel imagined that there were numerous parents who believed their children to have prodigious skills and boasted to teachers about it. She did not want to be one of them; and yet if the child was really talented, then shouldn&#x2019;t the nursery at least know?<br>&nbsp;<br>From upstairs there came the sound of a high-pitched voice&#x2014;something between a chuckle and a shout. Charlie was awake.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel nodded. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to talk about it. About what we do&#x2014;if anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He gave her a searching look. &#x201c;Do about what? About his being good at numbers? You think we should ignore it rather than encourage it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just not sure that it&#x2019;s in his interests. Would he be any happier if we encouraged him to be a mathematical prodigy?&#x201d; And there was something else that worried her: being a pushy mother. All mothers were pushy to an extent: one did not have to look far in the natural world to see mothers being pushy for their offspring&#x2014;any self-respecting lioness would make sure her cubs got their fair share&#x2014;but there were limits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we should push him too much.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie frowned. He encountered pushy parents in his work, and one in particular came to mind. She had written to him recently asking whether her son&#x2019;s innate musical ability was being adequately recognised and whether he was ready for a public performance. Jamie did not want the stage of the Usher Hall for Charlie, although if it came to that, he and Isabel would of course be in the front row. And Charlie would come onstage and need a box to stand on to climb on to the piano stool; or perhaps have his teddy bear carefully seated on the stool next to him while the conductor raised his baton to bring the accompanying orchestra to order. The frown became a smile. &#x201c;Can one ignore something like that? Wouldn&#x2019;t that be to waste it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did not have time to answer. Another cry came from Charlie, more urgent now, followed by a rattling of the bars at the top of his bed. Jamie began to leave the kitchen but turned at the door and said, &#x201c;Mozart was quite happy being Mozart, you know. He liked billiards. He kept a canary&#x2014;and a horse. He enjoyed practical jokes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel reflected on this while Jamie was upstairs. To play billiards, to keep a canary and a horse, and to enjoy practical jokes&#x2014;were very ordinary things like that the recipe for an enjoyable life?</p></p><h2>Using the GAPS Diet: 175 Recipes for Gaining Control of Your Gut Flora</h2><p><p> <b>With a foreword by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride and an introduction by Dr. Irene Hage, this comprehensive introduction to the GAPS diet along with 175 tasty recipes will help you gain control of your health and intestinal flora.</b> </p><p> Coined by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, "gut and psychology syndrome" - or GAPS - is a generic term used for a range of modern chronic diseases that have their roots in compromised intestinal flora.

Taking readers inside boardrooms to learn firsthand how the top decision-makers view and assess the employees under them, it offers invaluable advice on such career-building tactics and skills as getting noticed, networking, persuading others, knowing which battles to fight, and mastering the art of the quid pro quo. For all those who aspire to be part of the decision-making body of their organization,&nbsp;<i>The Secret Handshake</i>&nbsp;is the ultimate intelligence report on whom to trust and whom to watch out for, how to manage the inevitable conflicts that will arise, and how to read between the corporate lines. &nbsp;Shortly after its release, the hardcover edition of&nbsp;<i>The Secret Handshake</i><b>&nbsp;</b>reached Number 2 of the most popular Nonfiction Bestsellers among Amazon.com customers.</p><p><br><b>KATHLEEN KELLEY REARDON's</b>&nbsp;newest book, the mystery thriller SHADOW CAMPUS, is her debut novel. &nbsp;She has published 10 books and has been a featured political blogger for Huffington Post since 2006; is Professor Emerita at USC Marshall School of Business, and was named the UConn alumni association 2013 Humanitarian of the Year.&nbsp;She has appeared on The Today Show, NBC Nightly News and Good Morning America, and her research and writing have been the subject of hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles and broadcast news segments.&nbsp;Her first book, PERSUASION IN PRACTICE, (now in a revised edition), was described by Public Opinion Quarterly as "a landmark contribution to the field" of research and theory in persuasion.&nbsp;Her first trade book, THEY DON'T GET IT, DO THEY?, was based on her initial Harvard Business Review article "The Memo Every Woman Keeps in Her Desk," an HBR reprint best seller. Her latest HBR article is "Courage as a Skill."She published THE SECRET HANDSHAKE in 2000, an Amazon business and nonfiction bestseller that provides a rare and perceptive inside look at the politics of business; IT'S ALL POLITICS, which provides a deeper analysis of workplace politics; THE SKILLED NEGOTIATOR, and more recently COMEBACKS AT WORK: USING CONVERSATION TO MASTER CONFRONTATION.&nbsp;Her breakthrough Guide to International Business Gift Giving was used&nbsp;for many years&nbsp;by the White House Office of Protocol and protocol chiefs for nations and businesses worldwide.

She has consulted for many individuals, and companies large and small around the world on topics related to communication, persuasion, negotiation and politics at work.1<br><br>The Parameters of Organizational Power and Politics<br><br>There are two good reasons why the most coveted prize of business is called "the secret handshake." The first is that most people believe the political savvy necessary to break down barriers to the inner circles of organizations is inaccessible to all but a very few. That explains why there's a dearth of useful information devoted to the topic. Even organization experts consider politics an enigmatic puzzle. The second reason is that the path to the acquisition of this prize is purposely kept ambiguous by many of those who have successfully traversed it. They share sparingly the whereabouts and characteristics of the mazes, obstacles, and dangers that must be overcome in its pursuit. Some even deny that there is a path. After all, if just anyone could achieve the secret handshake, there would be no value in having attained it. It's an exclusive club, and certain conditions must be met for membership--certain hurdles overcome. Many of these hurdles have nothing to do with technical competence.<br><br>While the path to acquiring the secret handshake varies across organizations, both the existing research and the practical experiences of the many people I interviewed for this book indicate that political savvy is a prerequisite, more so even than job competence. This is especially true at higher levels of organizations where the signals are ever more ambiguous.<br><br>The prized executive offices are scarce, so competition is fierce. Yet at the loftier levels a high degree of professionalism is required. It's important for everyone to appear as though they are above pettiness and petulance. Consequently, political warfare at this level is subliminal and more often comprised of hidden minefields and stealth bombers than hand-to-hand combat. As the stakes get higher, the battle gets rougher, even if you can't see any weapons.<br><br>To the successful executive in a competitive organization, day-to-day life is politics. There is no doubt that a high level of field-based competence is needed to get ahead. But choose any two competent people, and the one who has political savvy, agility in the use of power, and the ability to influence others will go further.<br><br>Politics in the common vernacular refers to what other people do to get their way; as such it has negative connotations. Politics in organizations involves going outside the usual, formally sanctioned channels, something nearly every successful manager has done at one time or another. The real political moves are the ones not written down anywhere. Simply put, politics is an illegitimate means of getting things done.<br><br>So much of life is politics, especially at work. How should you approach a difficult situation? When should you take forceful action to stand up for yourself? How can you predict and prepare for others' reactions? Should you or shouldn't you fight a battle? If you do, how will you identify your allies and enemies? All these questions are part of daily life at work. As Caroline Nahas, managing director, Southern California, at Korn-Ferry International, sees it, there are two choices with regard to politics: "Either sit in the stands or get in the game and be a player." Yet Nahas doesn't see politics as necessarily--or even largely--negative: "To be politically astute, you need to read where the trend lines are, be ahead of the game, and focus on areas that you think will be important." There's nothing underhanded about this aspect of politics. In fact, it's constructive for the individual and the organization. Not all politics is so benign, however.<br><br>It didn't take Steve Harcourt, senior executive at a leading sports products company, long to learn this. As he describes it, he thought he'd been hired "to get all the money possible--to make a huge profit for the company." What he learned instead was that the CEO wanted increased profits but not at any cost. When Harcourt insulted one of the CEO's favored guys by suggesting that he do a few things differently, the response was not positive. Harcourt was edged out for a while. The CEO never said anything directly to him, but he got the message. He now believes, "If you ignore politics and make someone above you look bad, you're going to have a short career." So Harcourt's rule of thumb is to ask himself, "Can anything good come out of this?" That has gotten him the label of "political animal" at times, but as he sees it, politics is reality. You have to know when to speak up and when not to. Another Harcourt axiom: Don't tell the boss who doesn't want all the profits you could get for him that he isn't getting them. As Harcourt sees it, you have to know the primary goals and shape what you do to fit them.<br><br>Since political tactics aren't overtly sanctioned, they give rise to games that people play to build power bases, defeat rivals, and promote in-group members over those in the out-group. When such tactics work, over time they become embedded in the culture of the organization. At that point, few important things get accomplished in the absence of their application. Worse still, having gotten so used to playing games without having to think about how to do so, few if any of the people playing them are capable of articulating how they work. They can play them, but they can't explain how or why. They're like political robots irreversibly hardwired.<br><br>My primary aim in this book is to pull together the information gleaned from hundreds of interviews and probing discussions I've had with CEOs, senior managers, and high achievers in many fields during twenty years of business consulting, to shed light on how politics in organizations works. Moreover, I want to demonstrate how you can use political moves to gain admission to the inner circle of your organization--in short, to learn the secret handshake.<br><br>Politics and the Power Equation<br><br>While political strategies often operate in the service of wealth, they operate more often in the service of power--a resource for getting things done even in the face of resistance. The interesting thing about power is that it is often both a means to get ahead and the reward for getting there.<br><br>People who have valuable expertise, who control important resources or information, and those in positions of great authority not only can make things happen much more easily than those without power but also are in a position to increase their power and retain it. In order to win, the person engaging in politics need not always be the most powerful of those playing, but power does provide an advantage. It enables people to get things done even when others stand in opposition. Where one person has less formal power than others involved but accomplishes an objective nonetheless, it's likely that he or she used politics.<br><br>Power is at the heart of politics and may indeed be the heart of politics. Although power has a negative connotation for many people, it doesn't for those who've achieved the secret handshake. Without power they would not have made it. Without politics their sources of power would have been severely curtailed.<br><br>The Reciprocal Relationship Between Power and Politics<br><br>Even the most celebrated CEOs may never be far from losing power. A sharp drop in earnings, negative articles in <i>Fortune</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, or the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, or the loss of key employees can bring them down a few pegs or even cost them their jobs. Unless they own the business outright, those executives whose power is supposedly unquestioned are wise not to believe it.<br><br>Bill Owens, president of a fast-growing video distribution company, discovered this when he hired an employee named Sam to take on some of the demands of the business. What Owens liked about his new right-hand man was his ability to handle things that clogged Owens's in-box. It appeared that Owens had found himself someone who could even run the show in his absence. When some of his people began to tell him that the perfect new hire had flaws, he assumed they were jealous. "I like to give my people room to fail, so I didn't pay much attention at first. Then I heard that Sam had been telling my people, 'Don't bother Bill with anything. Everything goes through me.' Some of my people warned me that I was giving him too much power. They claimed that he'd begun to say, 'I speak for Bill.' I thought it was a harmless exaggeration. After all, he was getting work off my desk."<br><br>It wasn't until a year had passed that Owens began to notice that what he called "the tone" of the company was changing for the worse. But he continued to tell himself that there was no way that such a competent, friendly, flattering person as Sam could be the problem. The increased workload seemed a more likely reason for employee unrest. "Sam stroked people, especially me. But I've since learned that he penalized anyone who tried to go directly to me. While he was flattering me, he was controlling them. He started telling my people, 'Bill's a great guy, but he forgets things.' Then 'Bill's a great guy, but he gets angry easily.' He told customers that he'd be doing something different soon, hoping to lure them away and start his own business. First he took the decision power, and then little by little he undermined my credibility with my employees and customers."<br><br>Eventually, Owens recognized Sam's intentions. During a six-hour wait for a tow truck when his car broke down on the way home from a ski trip, Owens realized that the warnings of his more loyal employees had been well founded. When he returned to work, he ousted Sam and spent the next few years undoing the damage.<br><br>Owens's experience demonstrates that even very experienced managers can overlook destructive politics. It also demonstrates that it's never too late to learn to recognize and respond to abuses of politics and power. Political savvy is a skill, not a trait. No one is precluded from acquiring it. Yes, there are some people to whom political acumen seems to come more easily than to others, just as some people learn languages or higher mathematics with greater ease than others do. Owens had to learn the hard way. But he's more alert now. The crucial fact here is that political savvy is an achievable skill for recognizing when politics is operating and for using those politics to your advantage. And it is a skill prerequisite to attaining the coveted secret handshake. So our next step is to define how to acquire it.<br><br>2<br><br>Political Savvy<br><br>Being political at work garners two benefits that often outweigh the costs in terms of effort and difficulty. First, politics helps advance careers. To the extent that a person is achievement-oriented and works in an organization where politics flourishes, he or she will have to use politics to get ahead.<br><br>"I've had to become more politically sensitive as the company has gotten larger," a senior manager of a rags-to-riches-in-no-time-flat computer software company told me. "The people around here are getting so rich that they're even beginning to think they're competent. To get around them, I've had to be less direct, more strategic, and less up-front about my intentions."<br><br>The second benefit of knowing how politics works is self-defense. When politically inhibited people use politics, it's often more to protect themselves from others than to advance their own careers. Once the politically inhibited person becomes politically adept, regardless of the reason for doing so, he or she often finds that politics leads to rewards.<br><br>The Political Continuum<br><br>Whether politics is used to advance careers or for self-protection, the first step is discovering where you are on the political continuum, from the politically active on one end of the scale to the politically inhibited on the other end. Not only are the politically active comfortable with politics, they truly enjoy maneuvering around the rules to get things done. The politically inhibited, at the other end of the continuum, dislike political movers and shakers. They may play along to get along, as the saying goes, but they prefer not to do so.<br><br>The extent to which your position on the political continuum helps or hurts your career depends on the organizational culture in which you work. If an extremely politically active person works in an organization where politics is limited or discouraged, he or she is likely to be both unhappy and unwelcome. Intensely politically inhibited people who work in highly political organizations, divisions, or even offices can become equally unhappy and overstressed unless they find a protective mentor or a quiet niche in which to work.<br><br>Marcy Bergren Pine, a successful Los Angeles attorney, was politically inhibited early in her career. Nevertheless, Pine, who is now a partner in the prestigious law firm of Morrison and Foerster LLP, forged a path to success. Upon her graduation from Loyola she joined a leading law firm that, she freely admits, "needed a female attorney and I was it." This is where her conversion from being politically inhibited to politically active began. She came to appreciate the connections she could make in a high-profile law firm. In fact, as she soon learned, few things get done without connections.<br><br>As she reinvented aspects of herself in order to attain the rank of partner, Pine embarked on a campaign of impression management, not in order to be well liked, but in order to become respected and well connected. She changed her voice from "the social one I learned to use while being groomed for years to be a wife, to a lower-pitched, attorney-like voice. I stopped smiling so much and developed a little more of an edge, especially with aggressive businessmen and attorneys." Pine became an astute observer of the political landscape where she worked, and adjusted her actions to fit expectations. She set her sights on becoming partner and then proceeded to learn and do what it would take.<br><br>While sitting at a law firm dinner as a fifth-year associate with former secretaries of state and the interior William Rogers and William Clark, Pine realized that she had indeed arrived. "The most interesting thing," she said of the occasion, "is that I truly felt that I belonged there." The secret handshake had become hers.<br><br>For many people, politics is not just the ticket into the game but the means by which you come to decide which game is to be played. There is a time-honored view of success that says you're successful when the number of idiots under you is larger than the number over you. Alison May, COO at Esprit and former CFO of Patagonia, explains it this way: "I like to be the one ultimately making the call. I would much rather make a stupid decision and take the consequences than have to implement a stupid decision made by someone else. Therefore, I think I come across as someone confident, focused, and determined, because I am willing to accept the risks and negative consequences of being in a position of power."</p><h2>Disney Songs for Singers Edition: High Voice</h2><p>(Vocal Collection). 54 songs published in two keys, perfect for singers!

Her new relationship with a married man&#x2015;the antithesis of Rei&#x2015;has brought her life to a numbing stasis, and her relationships with her mother and daughter have spilled into routine, day after day. Kei begins making repeated trips to the seaside town of Manazuru, a place that jogs her memory to a moment in time she can never quite locate. Her time there by the water encompasses years of unsteady footing and a developing urgency to find <i>something</i>.</p> <p>Through a poetic style embracing the surreal and grotesque, a quiet tenderness emerges from these dark moments. <i>Manazuru</i> is a meditation on memory&#x2014;a profound, precisely delineated exploration of the relationships between lovers and family members.</p></p><p>Bestselling author <b>Hiromi Kawakami's</b> acclaim for her essays, stories, and novels include the Pascal Short Story Prize for New Writers and the Akutagawa Prize.

Enough distance lay between us that I couldn't tell if it was male or female. It made no difference, I ignored it, kept walking.</p> <p>I had set out before noon from the guest house on the inlet, headed for the tip of the cape. I stayed there last night, in that small building set amidst an isolated cluster of private houses, run by a man and woman who, judging from their ages, were mother and son.</p> <p>It was nearly nine when I arrived, two hours on a train from Tokyo, and by then the entrance to the inn was shut. The entrance was unremarkable: a low swinging iron gate like any other; two or three wiry, gnarled pines; nothing to indicate the lodge's name but a weathered nameplate, ink on wood, bearing the name "SUNA." <i>Suna</i> meaning <i>sand</i>.</p> <p>"Unusual name, isn't it?" I asked. "Suna?"</p> <p>"There are a few in the area," the mother replied.</p> <p>Her son's hair was graying, though he looked my age, forty-five or so.</p> <p>When he asked what time I wanted breakfast, it was as if I knew his voice. And yet it was obvious we had never met. Perhaps his voice reminded me of an acquaintance, only I couldn't think who. It wasn't the voice itself, it was a tremor in its depths that I recognized.</p> <p>I don't need breakfast, I answered, and he emerged from behind the counter to lead the way. My room was at the end of the hall. I'll come back to spread the futon, he announced dryly, the bath is downstairs. When he was gone, I drew the thin curtain aside and saw the sea before me. I could hear the waves. There was no moon. I strained my eyes, peering out into the darkness, trying to make out the waves, without success. The room felt warm, stuffy, as if it had been readied long in advance. I slid the window open and let the cool air flow in.</p> <br><br> <p>THE BATH WAS dim. Condensation dripped, slowly, from the ceiling.</p> <p>I let my thoughts turn to Seiji. I'll have to stay at the office to-night, he'd said. Back in Tokyo. He had described the nap rooms there for me more than once, but I could never picture them in detail. It's just a small, cramped room with a bed, that's all. We have three of them. If the door is locked, you know someone is sleeping inside, he tells me. Never having worked at a company, I picture a hospital room&#x2015;that's the best I can do. A pipe-frame bed with a beige blanket, enclosed by a curtain; a pair of slippers set out on a floor made of a material that amplifies the sound of footsteps; at the head of the bed, a help button and a temperature chart. </p><p>No, it's not like that&#x2015;just an ordinary, low-ceilinged room. Maybe a magazine lying on the floor that someone left behind. Ordinary. Seiji purses his lips. He never laughs aloud. When he smiles, it shows in his cheeks. This used to puzzle me; now I am used to it.</p> <p>Whenever I stay in those rooms, he says, by the time I fall asleep, the night is paling. Toward dawn, it grows quiet. Most of the lights are out on every floor, and once it's dark the sounds that echo through the building subside, too. I stretch my exhausted body out on the stiff bed, but I'm so on edge, it's hard to fall asleep&#x2015;I don't have any rituals for sleeping, not since I was a kid, but when I started spending nights at the office I took up my childhood practice again. I imagine myself floating in water, not half-submerged as I would be in real life, but lying right on the surface, stretched out perfectly still, First the back of my head and then my back, my bun, my heels, resting on the taut surface of the water, motionless, waiting, and as the parts of my body that come in contact with the water begin, little by little, to grow warm, I fall asleep, Seiji says, and once again purses his lips.</p> <br><br> <p>I WAS BACK from my bath. Unlike Sein, there was no need for me to sleep, so I didn't go to bed. Only when the sliver of outside color between the curtains began changing from black to blue did I feel tired. Seiji is probably nodding off right now, I told myself as I switched off the light and closed my eyes.</p> <p>It was past nine when I woke, and the room brimmed with light. The roar of the waves was louder than the night before. At the front desk, I asked the way to the cape. The son took a pencil and paper and traced the outline of the promontory; then, in the center, he drew in the roads. It looks like something, doesn't it, this shape? I said. Maybe, I don't know. The son's voice reminded me of someone, but still I couldn't think who. I recognized the shape immediately. It was the spitting image of a dragon: the head, from the neck up. Even the whiskers were there, under the nose.</p> <p>I'd say it's a bit under an hour to the tip on foot, said the son. It'll take longer if you walk slowly, his mother called out from the hack room. Oh, and&#x2015;I haven't made up my mind yet, but I might want to stay tonight, too, if you have a vacancy? I had seen no sign of other guests, I was the only person there last night, I was sure, so I thought I would only have to ask and they would say, Of course, you're welcome to stay. But the son cocked his head, uncertain.</p> <p>The fishermen come on Fridays. We're usually full up, as long as the waves aren't too choppy. Try giving us a call later. I nodded ambiguously, and left. According to the schedule at the bus stop, the next bus wasn't for half an hour. I wanted to leave my bag at the train station. I could make it to the station in half an hour, even on foot. I peered up the steep incline, wavering, then decided to wait. I went down to the shore.</p> <p>The ocean is dull. Nothing but waves tumbling in. I sat on a mid-sized rock and stared out over the sea. The wind blew hard. Every now and then a damp burst of spray reached me. The first day of spring had long since come and gone, but the day was chilly. Sand fleas scuttled out from under the rocks, then retreated.</p> <p>I never planned to come and spend the night here. I had to meet someone at Tokyo Station, we had art early dinner, it was seven when we finished. I was headed for the platform of the Chi:lei line when, unbidden, my feet turned and led me instead to the T�kaid� line, a train came, I got on. I'll go as far as Atami and then turn back, the Ch�o Line runs pretty late, it'll be fine, I told myself, and all of a sudden I felt so alone, I endured the loneliness as best I could, and then, unable to bear it, I got off the train. Manazuru was where I disembarked.</p> <p>I descended from the platform, walked along a narrow corridor, and exited the gate. The station faced a plaza. The information kiosk had been closed for hours. I asked the taxi driver to take me to a guest house. It's small, he told me, but it's a decent place. He let me out in front of the house with the nameplate:</p> <p>"SUNA."</p> <p>I called Mother from the train. What should I put in Momo's lunch tomorrow? she asked. You can use anything but the chicken in the refrigerator, I started to say, then changed my mind. Use anything, anything at all. I'm sorry, going off all of a sudden, I said. Mother replied, That's all right. Her voice sounded very distant. I had the sense something was following me then, too, and turned to look, but I was alone, standing in the space between two cars, where I had gone to use my cell phone. No sign of any-one, not even a shadow.</p> <p>I thought I glimpsed the ocean from the train window. In the darkness, I couldn't be sure it was the water, or sure it wasn't. Every so often my work takes me away from home, I leave Mother and Momo alone, together, but I never simply go, without warn-ing, the way I did this time. I don't stay out with Seiji. He has kids of his own. Three kids, and a wife. His middle child is Momo's age. Ninth grade.</p> <br><br> <p>I RODE THE bus back to the station, then started out again, on foot, toward the cape.</p> <p>Surprising, I thought, that they let me stay, without even asking what I was doing there: I had only one small bag with me, and by the time I arrived it was no longer even early evening. I pondered the name on the nameplate, as well. <i>Sum.</i> Odd that it didn't strike me last night. It wasn't the sound of the name. It was that I couldn't think of a given name that went well with it.</p> <p>The road was straight with a gentle incline. Near the port, it began to trace the line of the shore. Each passing car swerved away, giving me a wide berth. Closer to the station there had been people heading in the other direction, but here the street was empty. I approached a cluster of inns and restaurants serving fresh seafood; beyond them there was only the steadily ascending road. In the inns and restaurants, no sign of life.</p> <p>I did know who the son's voice reminded me of. My missing husband, who disappeared without warning twelve years ago&#x2015;my husband, as he went to sleep. When drowsiness eddied around him like a haze, straddling that threshold, his voice like a child's. <i>Kei</i>. When he said my name, there was sweetness deep in his voice, a hint of moisture, so that for some reason I heard him, beneath the familiar adult male skin, as someone on the cusp of manhood, a boy, or perhaps a young man, it was hard to say which.</p> <p>My husband vanished, leaving nothing behind. To this day, I have had no news.</p></p><h2>Socialism: The Failed Idea That Never Dies</h2><p>Socialism is strangely impervious to refutation by real-world experience.<br>Over the past hundred years, there have been more than two dozen attempts to build a socialist society, from the Soviet Union to Maoist China to Venezuela.

This book contains Karl May&#39;s whole Winnetou Trilogy. Charlie, the young German immigrant, arrives to the Wild West, and soon becomes Old Shatterhand, the hero, who can knock out any enemy with a single blow, a warrior, who kills only when he has no other choice. He becomes Winnetou&#39;s blood brother, and the death-daring adventures start, even though he had already hunted bison, caught mustangs, killed a grizzly, and found himself in the war between the Apache and Kiowa. He teams up with Old Death against the Ku-Klux-Klan, and bandits who are preparing an attack on a silver mine. He defends trains against Indian attacks enticed by the white villains, helps out Old Firehand against a Ponca raid, defeats the bandits of the Llano Estacado with Sans-ear, the hunter, and attempts to recover the treasure of the Apache. In his quest for adventure, Old Shatterhand never forgets his desire to help the Native Americans. This unabridged English translation retains the exciting adventures, and the strong moral conviction of May&#39;s original book, while modernising the style, and editing parts that were erroneous or may evoke bad associations. With this editing the core of May&#39;s world, the action, the dreaming of heroic deeds, and the struggle for a kind of justice have become more emphasised, and more accessible to the modern reader.</p><p>Karl May (1843-1912) is probably still the most read German author in Germany and some other countries. He was born in a large, poor family. After some rather turbulent years, he started to write adventure stories for the youth, although as his popularity increased, more and more adults read his books. The style of his books is the style of the village story tellers. There are improbable adventures, there is no constraint on the soaring fantasy, yet while reading them one can visualise the situation. His Westerns are probably the most read: Winnetou, The Treasure of Silver Lake, The Son of Bear Hunter, The Spirit of Llano Estacado, and The Oil Prince. Much of the ethnographic and some of the geographic details are erroneous in these books, partly because May had never been to the West, partly because these errors helped him develop the story. May&#39;s stories are read for the adventure, and for some of the moral values which are prominent in his books. This appeal in particular to the youth: there are no moral ambiguities there: the good and evil struggle, and the good always wins, while the reader cannot be sympathetic to those who represent the evil. May&#39;s books were already edited in his life time, but especially after 1913. Over the decades some of May&#39;s errors have been corrected by his publishers, and the remarks or contexts that could raise uncomfortable associations have either been removed or rephrased.</p><h2>Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm</h2><p><i>Infinite Potential</i> is the first biography of David Bohm brilliant physicist, explorer of consciousness, student of Oppenheimer, friend to Einstein, and enemy of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Although he battled bouts of crippling depression, Bohm proved to be one of the twentieth century's most original thinkers, influencing the fields of physics, philosophy, psychology, language, and education. In this compelling narrative, David Peat explains Bohm's life and landmark scientific work, including his famous &#x201d;hidden variables&#x201d; causal interpretation of quantum mechanics, which created a storm of controversy, yet may well be the only theory that describes the true nature of reality.</p><p><b>F. David Peat,</b> renowned author of many general books on science&#x2014;including, with David Bohm, <i>Science, Order &amp; Creativity</i>&#x2014;was a friend and colleague of David Bohm for more than twenty years.Dismissed by establishment scientists as a maverick or mystical rebel, American physicist David Bohm (1917-1992) sought a holistic physics, a unified vision of matter and mind, brain and consciousness. His search for an alternative quantum theory led him to formulate a cosmology depicting a universe of infinite levels, each qualitatively different yet part of an interconnected whole. In this brilliant intellectual biography, science writer Peat, Bohm's longtime friend and colleague, portrays an intensely cerebral man gripped by periods of crippling depression, who had an acute need of a guru or father figure, whether mentor J. Robert Oppenheimer or Indian philosopher/ teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti, and who ultimately felt betrayed by each of them. Born in Pennsylvania to a Hungarian Jewish immigrant father and a manic-depressive mother of Lithuanian Jewish extraction, Bohm, who settled in London in the late 1950s, was a disillusioned Marxist thinker (he briefly joined the U.S. Communist Party in 1942) who bravely refused to name names to a Congressional witchhunt committee when called to testify in 1949. Peat's probing exploration of Bohm's quest for an "implicate order," a deeper reality beneath the surface appearance of things, helps explain his influence on writers, artists, psychologists and philosophers as well as open-minded physicists. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Andrew Jackson</h2><p>By "the foremost Jacksonian scholar of our time" <em>(New York Times),</em> the critically acclaimed and most concise biography of Andrew Jackson that takes a comprehensive look at the political, personal, and military life of the seventh president of the United States.</p><p>This brief biography focuses more on the political career of Andrew Jackson than on his military heroism at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812.

How could a man so lacking in capacity, so void of any intellectual heft, become the president of the United States? How did Trump, a man with no detectable personal qualities outside of resentment and the will to dominate, appeal to millions of Americans and win the highest office in the land? The American right has spent decades turning away from reasoned discourse toward a rhetoric of pure resentment&#x2014;it&#x2019;s this shift that laid the groundwork for Trump&#x2019;s ascendency. <br><br>In Troll Nation, journalist Amanda Marcotte outlines how Trump was the inevitable result of American conservatism&#x2019;s degradation into an ideology of blind resentment. For years now, the purpose of right wing media, particularly Fox News, has not been to argue for traditional conservative ideals, such as small government or even family values, so much as to stoke bitterness and paranoia in its audience. Traditionalist white people have lost control over the culture, and they know it, and the only option they feel they have left is to rage at a broad swath of supposed enemies ? journalists, activists, feminists, city dwellers, college professors ? that they blame for stealing &#x201c;their&#x201d; country from them. <br><br>Conservative pundits, politicians, and activists have abandoned any hope of winning the argument through reasoned discourse, and instead have adopted a series of bad faith claims, conspiracy theories, and culture war hysterics. Decades of these antics created a conservative voting base that was ready to elect a mindless bully like Donald Trump.</p><p><b>Amanda Marcotte</b> is a Senior Political Writer for Salon.

An emotional rescue. Two lives forever changed. <br><br></b>Laurie's dreams had been&nbsp;shattered&nbsp;before she came to work at Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch&#x2014;the ranch of rescued dreams&#x2014;where broken horses and broken children encounter healing every day. In an attempt to soothe her aching soul, Laurie reached out to&nbsp;save a dog in need. And she&nbsp;soon began to realize that the dog was rescuing <i>her</i>. <br>&nbsp;<br>An inspiring true story told through the engaging voice of Kim Meeder, <i>Blind Hope </i>reveals poignant life lessons Laurie experienced from her ailing, yet courageous canine friend. Despite the blindness of her dog&#x2014;and her own heart&#x2014;Laurie uncovered what she really needed most: authentic love, unconditional trust, and true acceptance, faults and all.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Laurie and her dog, Mia, both learned to follow the lead of a master they couldn&#x2019;t see, Laurie discovered the transforming power of God&#x2019;s grace even for&nbsp;imperfect and selfish people&#x2014;and she experienced a greater love than she had ever known.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Love is a bridge that stands firm through difficulties and connects one heart directly to another, not because of how it looks, but because of what it <i>is</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;Kim Meeder, <i>Blind Hope</i></p><p><b>Kim Meeder</b> is the author of <i>Hope Rising</i> and <i>Bridge Called Hope</i>. Along with her husband, Troy, she owns and operates Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch in central Oregon. Crystal Peaks is a nonprofit organization that rescues abused and neglected horses and pairs them with disadvantaged children, offering the children a place of safety, peace, and hope. In 2004, Kim&nbsp;received the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award, one of the nation&#x2019;s highest honors for public service. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Laurie Sacher</b> is a team leader at Crystal Peaks Youth. Laurie graduated from Point Loma Nazarene University in 2003 and taught English as Second Language in Spain before returning to her native California roots to pursue her passion for kids and animals.It was seventeen degrees. Earth, snow, and sky converged into a milky emissary, whispering a timeless message of hushed peace. It was January in Central Oregon, and a glorious ice fog had coated every blade and branch with a one-inch layer of spiny rime. The frozen filigree embellished everything with its delicate crystal creations. Muted light shrouded all living things, now held captive in the icy embrace. The silent landscape murmured the promise of deep, abiding rest.<br>&nbsp;<br>For me that rest would have to wait. I turned my truck off the dirt road that stretches north of Tumalo Reservoir and parked in the snow. From this access point, a wide wilderness invites adventurers to explore its latticed tangle of forgotten logging roads. I stowed my keys in a zippered pocket in my black running jacket and pulled on a pair of stretchy gloves. Soon my friend would meet me here for a long Sunday afternoon jog. Laurie and I were training for a marathon, her first and my tenth.<br>&nbsp;<br>From the cab of my truck, I reveled in the peaceful setting. Weary from a heavy week of work, my heart welcomed the refuge of quiet. The small hiatus of silence soon was invaded, however, by the growing excitement of my dog, a Queensland blue heeler. She whined in anticipation, willing me to open the truck door to one of her favorite activities: a run in the snow with her mom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like all true ranchers, I never go anywhere without my faithful dog. Seven, or Sevi for short, is my third hand and foot and the thinking half of my brain. I&#x2019;m sure she would finish my sentences if she could talk&#x2014;and do a much better job of it! Dogs that live with us&#x2014;really live with us&#x2014;often know their human friends better than we know ourselves. <br>&nbsp;<br>The comfort of my truck&#x2019;s heater subsided, and brittle barbs of frigid air prickled through the glass. I snuggled my hat down over my ears and zipped up my jacket under my chin.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I stepped out of the truck, cold air engulfed me like an unseen wave. With my first quick breaths, I inhaled what felt like a million needles of ice. The assault on my throat and lungs drove me to hoist my collar even higher to cover my mouth. While waiting for Laurie, I followed my prerun regimen, gearing up to spend a few hours in significant cold. I alternated jogging in place with pogo jumps to remain loose and warm. Sevi jumped around me in ecstatic leaps. Her chorus of happy yips beckoned me, as if to say, &#x201c;Hurry up! We have a wonderful world to explore!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In matters of life, dogs just get it. Sevi has taught me volumes more than I could ever hope to teach her. When it comes to demonstrating qualities like respect, forgiveness, and obedience and expressing emotions like love, joy, and peace, my dog operates on a level I can only hope to attain. Few creatures know how to maximize the moment better than a dog.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sevi&#x2019;s example constantly reminds me that ten minutes ago is already in the past, so why think about the future when right now is just so much fun? Her exuberance for life shows me how to really enjoy the rich and simple pleasures found within each moment of my days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sevi and I persisted in our frigid dance until Laurie arrived. Her white car was almost invisible against the pallid backdrop of the wintry High Desert. After a quick hug, Laurie and I agreed on our time frame and what trail to explore. The breath from our brief conversation froze into thin veils, drifting above us like drowsy angels. Not wishing to stiffen in the deep cold, Laurie retrieved her dog, Mia, and the four of us set off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sevi and Mia collided in a jubilant canine hug and then bounded up the trail ahead of Laurie and me. Our once relaxed breath now rose behind us in measured white puffs. Shoulder to shoulder, like twin steam engines, we chugged over a crunchy mantle of frozen snow. Every stride took us deeper into a pristine realm of winter wilderness.<br>&nbsp;<br>One metered breath at a time, our voices soon merged with the serene environment. Like a smooth stone skipping across a mirrored pond, our dialogue bounced from one subject to another. After several miles, I noticed something else between Laurie&#x2019;s words. Because the rhythm of her voice had maintained a steady flow, I hadn&#x2019;t been aware of it earlier. It wasn&#x2019;t until Mia missed the turnoff onto a narrow, frozen logging road that I heard it&#x2014;Laurie&#x2019;s voice calling her straying dog back to her side.<br>&nbsp;<br>All during our run, Laurie had been guiding Mia with voice commands that barely punctuated our conversation. Laurie achieves this weaving of dialogue and instruction with such intrinsic skill I had all but forgotten that she does it for one reason: Mia is almost completely blind.<br>&nbsp;<br>It wasn&#x2019;t until Mia bolted in the opposite direction that Laurie finally stopped and backtracked, calling out to her wayward friend. Unsure of how to help, I watched as Mia crashed through the frozen brush. She clambered over logs and tripped in a dense tangle of underbrush. Finally, overwhelmed by an icy prison she couldn&#x2019;t see, Mia stopped. A tinge of concern crept into my heart as Mia began to move again, turning in tight circles. She swung her head back and forth in an effort to locate her master. Laurie waded into the wintry snarl and broke through to where Mia was trapped. With gentle hands, Laurie turned her blind dog back in the direction of the correct path, and together they started out again.<br>&nbsp;<br>I could hear Laurie&#x2019;s low voice guiding her courageous dog. &#x201c;Easy, easy...step up, that&#x2019;s it. Here...here. Good girl.&#x201d; In unison they crunched up the trail toward me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Laurie and I often run together, but I still admired their interaction as they trotted up to rejoin Sevi and me. Laurie resumed our run and conversation as if nothing more than a comma had passed between us since our last words.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mia fell in right behind us, following the sound of our feet drumming over the frozen layer of earth and snow. I doubted &nbsp;that any onlooker would have been able to detect that Mia is blind. By tucking in at Laurie&#x2019;s heels, Mia relaxed behind a shield of protection she could sense but not see.<br>&nbsp;<br>As long as Mia stayed close enough to hear Laurie&#x2019;s muted commands&#x2014;and obeyed them&#x2014;she was able to navigate an unknown world. Yet the moment Mia stopped listening to her master and chose instead to wander, everything changed. Once Mia was separated from Laurie, her world quickly compressed into a dangerous and lonely place.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mia was following the sound of her master&#x2019;s footsteps. Her previous experiences had taught her that this was a sound she could trust. A sound that kept her safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>I smiled at Laurie and pointed a gloved thumb over my shoulder at her dog. My words were measured out between breaths. &#x201c;What faith...to follow a master...you cannot see.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Message in the Bottle: How Queer Man Is, How Queer Language Is, and What One Has to Do with the Other</h2><p><p>In <i>Message</i> i<i>n the</i> <i>Bottle</i>, Walker Percy offers insights on such varied yet interconnected subjects as symbolic reasoning, the origins of mankind, Helen Keller, Semioticism, and the incredible Delta Factor.

Jeannie Baker makes her home in Sydney, Australia.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 4--When baby Tracy is first brought to her new home, the view of the urban neighborhood as seen through her window is not a pleasant one. Billboards and graffiti are everywhere, garbage is strewn across the streets, and only a few meager plants are fighting their way through the cracks in the cement. Bit by bit, as Tracy grows, the area is slowly reclaimed, so that the final view through the window is clean, lush, and green, with birds nesting peacefully in new trees and vistas that reveal glimpses of the now-visible blue river. In each of the double-page views through the window, readers can note not just the physical changes, but also the people in the community actively engaged in affecting those changes and producing a true home. As she did in <i>Window</i> (Greenwillow, 1991), Baker uses natural materials to create detailed, arresting collages that tell a story in which words are superfluous. Children can pore over these pages again and again and make fresh discoveries with each perusal. Whether enjoyed independently or incorporated into units on the environment, communities, or artistic technique, this is a book to treasure.<i>--Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They were proud of her, but they also wished she had chosen other, <i>safer</i> places to offer help. Not the war-torn Middle East when the threat wasn&#x2019;t just from other nations but <i>within</i> their country as well from groups, divided by religious, political and cultural differences and unable to tolerate the differences of others. They all wanted to force others to bend to their way of life, and the lengths they went to impose their beliefs on those who didn&#x2019;t share the same ideology still managed to appall and bewilder Honor despite the fact that she should be hardened by now. Nothing should shock her. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Every day she managed to be surprised, because there was always more. When she thought she&#x2019;d seen it all, something always managed to catch her off guard.</p><p>But to become jaded and cynical was the kiss of death. The day she could no longer feel compassion for the innocent and the oppressed and anger at the senseless violence and despair that was so pervasive in the region she served was the day she needed to find a staid, mindless nine-to-five job, have a safe life where the most dangerous thing she encountered was rush-hour traffic.</p><p>Honor put her hand on the boy&#x2019;s arm to direct him to his waiting mother, who was already holding the large care package filled with things most people took for granted but were precious commodities in villages where running water was a luxury.</p><p>The entire building suddenly shook and the floor buckled beneath Honor&#x2019;s feet as though an earthquake were occurring.</p><p>No one screamed. But looks of terror, all too common on the faces of people who&#x2019;d become dear to Honor, were shared by everyone. Eerie silence ensued, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The world exploded around them, a terrible storm, a whirling vortex of heat, fire and the acrid smell of explosives.</p><p>And blood.</p><p>Death had a smell all of its own. And Honor had seen more blood and death, had smelled it, had witnessed the horrible sight of the very essence of life slowly seep from a once-vibrant human being. An innocent child. A mother seeking only to protect her young. A father slaughtered in front of his entire family.</p><p>Chaos reigned as people ran, no clear direction in mind, and yet Honor viewed the goings-on calmly, as if she were apart from her body and viewing dispassionately the attack on the relief center. One of her coworkers&#x2014;her friend&#x2014;screamed at her to take cover and then went utterly still, death in her eyes as blood bloomed over her chest. She sagged like a puppet, her expression not one of pain but of great sorrow. And regret.</p><p>Tears burned the corners of Honor&#x2019;s eyes as she finally forced herself into motion. There were children to shield. Women to save. The vicious extremist cell would not take them all. It was an oath, a litany that repeated over and over in her mind as she shoved children and mothers alike out of the rear exit and into the desert heat.</p><p>One of the women grasped Honor&#x2019;s hand when Honor turned to go back in and pleaded with her in Arabic to come with them. To run. To save herself. The extremists would have no mercy. Especially for Westerners.</p><p>Honor gently extricated her hand from the woman&#x2019;s desperate hold. &#x201c;May Allah be with you,&#x201d; she whispered, praying in her heart that God, any God, <i>every</i> God, would stop the hate and bloodshed. The senseless killing of the good and innocent.</p><p>Then she turned and ran back into the building, or what was left of it. Dimly she registered that the lightweight but cool western flip-flops she usually wore had somehow fallen off her feet in the chaos surrounding her, but the last thing on her mind was protecting her feet when her life was at stake.</p><p>She searched frantically for her fellow relief workers. The two doctors who worked tirelessly day and night, sometimes going many nights without sleep because the need for medical aid was so great. The nurses who did the work that many physicians in the United States did and with far less advanced technology or diagnostic tools.</p><p>Everywhere she turned, all she saw was blood, rivers of blood. And death. The stench made her stomach revolt and she clamped a hand over her mouth to prevent herself from being violently ill and to silence the scream that welled from the very depths of her soul.</p><p>There was no solace to be found anywhere she looked, but she could at least be grateful that she didn&#x2019;t see the bodies of many children, or their mothers. Most had fled, well trained and accustomed to such attacks. Honor&#x2019;s comrades, her friends, the people who had the same calling as she, hadn&#x2019;t fared as well.</p><p>The very earth exploded beneath her. Around her. Stone and debris pelted her, battering her in an endless wave of pain and terror. She took a single step, wincing when something sharp cut into her tender foot. And then the already sagging roof collapsed, sending her sprawling painfully across the ravaged floor. Debris rained down on her. No, that was the ceiling caving in on her, pinning her beneath rock, rubble, a shattered beam. The cloud of dust and smoke was so thick she couldn&#x2019;t suck air into her tortured lungs.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was the thickness of the smoke and decimated plaster that made it impossible for her to breathe or if it was the mountain of rubble she was buried under, pressing mercilessly down on her until she was sure every bone in her body would be crushed, unable to withstand the unbearable strain.</p><p>Pain was present. It was there. She knew it. But it was distant. As if it were trying to penetrate the thickest fog surrounding her. Numbness crawled insidiously over and through her body, and she wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was a blessing to be unable to feel what had to be excruciating pain or if this was the curse of death.</p><p>Her death.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered sluggishly as she struggled to remain conscious, too afraid that if she gave in to the encroaching darkness, death would win the ultimate battle.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a stranger to death. She saw it on a daily basis. Nor was she in denial of the enormous risk she took by working in a country not only at constant war with neighboring countries, all with different agendas, beliefs and differing levels of fanaticism, but also divided within their own borders, each region determined to overtake the entire country and force their will on those with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>And then there were those who <i>needed</i> no reason to murder, terrorize and victimize their fellow countrymen. Those were the worst of all. Unpredictable. They reeked of fanaticism, and their only agenda was to strike fear in the hearts of all who crossed them. They wanted glory. They wanted to be feared by their enemy and revered by other factions too afraid to engage them in battle.</p><p>They wanted the world to know of them. Who they were. They wanted people to whisper their name as if afraid of conjuring them by speaking of the monsters too loudly. They&#x2019;d fast learned that the quickest way to elevate their status, gain worldwide media attention and be able to recruit the elite, the best of the best, ones not only unafraid to give their lives for their &#x201c;cause&#x201d; but who embraced the glory of being a martyr was to target Westerners. Americans in particular.</p><p>The U.S. media gave the glory seekers precisely what they craved. Around-the-clock coverage every time they launched another attack. And with that attention came ambition for more. They&#x2019;d grown bolder, rapidly expanding their network, their power giving pause to the very nations that would ordinarily condone such hatred of the West.</p><p>Such power made leaders of oil-rich countries nervous. So much so that an unprecedented summit had been called, bringing together sworn enemies to discuss the ever-growing problem of a fanatical group with power, wealth, military might and unprecedented numbers joining with each passing day.</p><p>Men and women from all corners of the earth. What could possibly inspire such hatred? Such a thirst for pain, violence, hurt and suffering?</p><p>Honor shuddered as the numb shell surrounding her showed signs of fragmenting, and for a moment pain assaulted her, taking her breath. Black crept into her vision, the light growing dimmer and dimmer. Tears burned like acid, but she refused to give in to them. She was alive. At least for now. None of the other relief workers had been as fortunate.</p><p>The building looked as though a meteor had hurtled through the earth&#x2019;s atmosphere and decimated the entire area. Half of the roof had collapsed, and judging by the creaking and groaning that echoed with the faintest whisper of wind, the rest wasn&#x2019;t far behind.</p><p>She&#x2019;d never get out. And for that matter, perhaps her fellow relief workers <i>had</i> received mercy from a higher being. A quick death was surely better than what awaited any survivors discovered by the bloodthirsty savages who&#x2019;d wrought such devastation.</p><p>Why had she been left to suffer? Why was she without mercy and grace? What sin had she committed to survive only to be condemned to hell, a fate worse than death? A cold chill dug deep into her battered body and clung tenaciously to her bones, her blood. She was freezing from the deepest recesses of her soul when around her the world was on fire, the flames of hell greedily consuming its victims.</p><p>&#x201c;Get a grip, Honor,&#x201d; she muttered, her words slurring, evidence that she was in shock.</p><p>Here she was whining because she was alive. She&#x2019;d survived the impossible and worse, her coworkers hadn&#x2019;t and she&#x2019;d dared to <i>envy</i> them? She&#x2019;d been spared when no one else had. It had to mean something. Her life had purpose. There was still much for her to do. God wasn&#x2019;t finished with her yet, and here she lay amid the rubble of destruction acting the ungrateful child for having lived. Never had she felt so ashamed. What would her family think? They certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be upset that she was still alive. Her death would cause them endless pain. She was the baby. The youngest of six siblings and she was dearly loved by all. They might not like that she put herself at such risk, but they understood her calling and supported her. They were proud of her. If for no one else, she would survive for them.</p><p>The sound of raised voices, barked orders and debris being shoved aside froze Honor where she lay trapped. Panic welled, her heart accelerating wildly. Her breaths, already ragged and painful, grew even more so. She closed her eyes and willed herself not to make a sound.</p><p>The soldiers were picking through the ruins looking specifically for the Westerners&#x2014;the people who ran the relief center and offered aid to refugees. Their triumph over the success of their attack sickened Honor. There were gleeful shouts as one after another, a worker was found dead. Tears tightened her throat when it was suggested that the bodies be dragged from the clinic and lined up so photos could be taken and shown to the world, a warning to others that their presence was offensive.</p><p>Oh God, what would happen when they found her? They were systematic in their search, almost as if they knew who the relief workers were and how many there were. If they were happy over so many dead, how much more excited would they be to have a live hostage? Someone to make an example of.</p><p>The building creaked and groaned, the remaining walls protesting the weakness of the structure. More debris rained down, pelting the entire area. Honor barely managed to hold in a sound of pain when something hit the objects covering her, causing them to crush her even more.</p><p>The invaders were suddenly cautious and wary, their talk going to whether it was safe to continue their systematic body count. When one suggested they get out immediately&#x2014;before what remained of the shell of the building fell down around their ears&#x2014;an argument broke out, the voices loud and harsh and entirely too close for Honor&#x2019;s comfort.</p><p>They were near her and drawing closer all the time. She could all but hear their breaths, feel the urgent exhalation over her neck even though she knew that wasn&#x2019;t possible. But she felt hunted. Just as prey surely must feel when a predator was closing in for the kill.</p><p>She closed her eyes and prayed to live when just moments earlier she&#x2019;d lamented the fact that she <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> died. A fervent prayer became a litany in her mind not only to live, but to survive. To escape, unscathed, the terrible fate she&#x2019;d endure were she discovered by the soldiers who thought nothing of raping, torturing and killing women. Or children, for that matter.</p><p>A shudder quaked through her body before she could call it back, and then she held her breath, hoping she hadn&#x2019;t betrayed herself. She forced calm she didn&#x2019;t feel to settle over her body, blocking out the pain and gut-wrenching fear. Never had she been more terrified than she was at this moment. No amount of preparing, no number of close calls with militants bent on destruction could possibly have given her a glimpse into the reality she&#x2019;d spent too many months to count mentally bracing herself for.</p><p>In her heart she&#x2019;d felt it inevitable that she would face ultimate fear, pain, but she&#x2019;d never truly allowed herself to think she could be killed doing what she felt was her calling in life. Her parents had tried to convince her. They&#x2019;d pleaded with her in the beginning, even going so far as to say they didn&#x2019;t want to lose their &#x201c;baby.&#x201d;</p><p>Her four older brothers and older sister had all gathered to attempt...</p></p><h2>Nonnos: Dionysiaca, Volume I, Books 1-15 (Loeb Classical Library No. 344)</h2><p><p>Nonnos of Panopolis in Egypt, who lived in the fifth century of our era, composed the last great epic poem of antiquity. The <i>Dionysiaca</i>, in 48 books, has for its chief theme the expedition of Dionysus against the Indians; but the poet contrives to include all the adventures of the god (as well as much other mythological lore) in a narrative which begins with chaos in heaven and ends with the apotheosis of Ariadne's crown. The wild ecstasy inspired by the god is certainly reflected in the poet's style, which is baroque, extravagant, and unrestrained. It seems that Nonnos was in later years converted to Christianity, for in marked contrast to the <i>Dionysiaca</i>, a poem dealing unreservedly with classical myths and redolent of a pagan outlook, there is extant and ascribed to him a hexameter paraphrase of the Gospel of John.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Dionysiaca</i> is in three volumes.</p></p><p><p>William Henry Denham Rouse (1863&#x2013;1950) was Headmaster of the Perse School and a founding editor of the Loeb Classical Library.</p></p><h2>Dracula in Istanbul: The Unauthorized Version of the Gothic Classic</h2><p><p>For the first time in English comes a remarkable literary discovery. In 1928, Turkish author Ali Riza Seyfioglu pirated Bram Stoker&#x2019;s <em>Dracula</em>, rewriting it with new material, patriotic overtones, and Islam. A rare example of a &#x201c;bootleg&#x201d; novel, it&#x2019;s also the first adaptation to plainly identify Dracula as the historical warlord Vlad the Impaler.</p> <p>When a modern Istanbul is threatened by the invasion of an ancient vampire, three veterans of the Turkish War of Independence are thrust into a conflict with their nation&#x2019;s hereditary enemy. Seyfioglu boldly reworks Stoker&#x2019;s classic tale, retelling it from the unique perspective of a people once routed by the real-life Dracula.</p> <p><em>Dracula in Istanbul: The Unauthorized Version of the Gothic Classic</em> also includes a foreword by <em>Anno Dracula</em> author Kim Newman, an introduction by Turkish translation scholar Sehnaz Tahir Gurcaglar, an afterword on the 1953 movie adaptation by film scholar Iain Robert Smith, and several rare photos from the film.

Her website is CarolHigginsClark.com.<b>Chapter 1</b> <p> Regan Reilly sat down at the scarred oak desk in her cozy office on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Developers were dying to take a wrecking ball to the ancient structure, but so far the building managed to remain standing, which made Regan very happy. A private investigator who worked alone, Regan loved everything about her work, except the fact that it kept her three thousand miles from her boyfriend of ten months, Jack Reilly. Jack was the head of the major case squad in New York City. He was coming out to spend the weekend with her, but that was still four more days away. </p><p> Monday mornings, Regan thought, as she took a sip of coffee. They're the pits even if you like your job. There's just something about them. For one thing, they certainly put a damper on Sunday nights. I shouldn't complain, though, Regan mused. This Monday morning brings me one day closer to seeing Jack. </p><p> The quiet of the early October morning was broken by the ring of the phone. </p><p> "Regan Reilly." </p><p> "Wow. Am I talking to Regan Reilly after all these years?" a male voice asked. </p><p> "You're talking to Regan Reilly," she assured the caller. "Who's this?" </p><p> "You don't remember me?" </p><p> Here we go, Regan thought. It's not even nine o'clock on a Monday morning, and the weirdos are already on the horn. Don't these people ever give it a rest? "I have no idea who you are," Regan answered simply as she turned on her computer. </p><p> "I'll give you three guesses. But only three." </p><p> All this before my first cup of coffee, Regan thought. "Why don't you call back later," she suggested. "I'm sure you'll have your identity figured out by then. Bye." She started to put down the phone when she heard a shout from the other end. </p><p> "Wait! Regan, it's Danny Madley. The tree boy!" </p><p> Regan's hand froze in midair. Her mind raced back in time. The tree boy. No, it couldn't be. She pulled the phone back to her ear. "Tree Boy?" </p><p> "Yes!" he replied triumphantly. </p><p> "Danny Madley." Regan laughed. "I guess you haven't changed a bit." She pictured the gangly boy from her grammar school days in New Jersey. Danny was the class clown, the one who always had a scheme going. In second grade the teacher refused to give him a speaking part in the school production of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> because he'd been such a nudge. She cast him as one of the trees. But, of course, trees talk in <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> and Danny managed to blurt out a few lines he'd written especially for the occasion. He even stuffed apples in his pockets to throw at poor lost Dorothy, a scene the teacher had deliberately omitted from the official version of the play. The kids always called him Tree Boy after that. That is, after he'd spent a week in solitary confinement in a corner of the principal's office. </p><p> "You can tell that I haven't grown up?" </p><p> "That can be a good thing," Regan replied. "So, Danny, to what do I owe the honor of this phone call?" </p><p> "For one thing, I know you're a private investigator." </p><p> "You know that, huh?" </p><p> "Yes. You're always mentioned in the articles about your mother and her books, and I read something recently about when your father was kidnapped. Your new boyfriend's name is Reilly. Very cute." </p><p> Regan's mind wandered back to Christmastime when her father had been kidnapped in New York City. It was when she met Jack. He had been in charge of the investigation and had worked day and night to get Luke back. Jack always joked that it helped to get on the good side of a girl's family from the beginning. And Luke always said he'd do anything to contribute to his child's happiness -- even if it meant getting kidnapped. Regan's mother, Nora, the suspense writer, was just thrilled that Regan finally had a decent boyfriend, however they happened to meet. Regan now smiled and informed Danny, "Jack Reilly is a great guy." </p><p> "I'm sure he is. Regan, I looked you up on Our Lady of Good Counsel's website and saw that you were registered. That's how I got your phone number." </p><p> "Those school websites are kind of fun, so I figured why not?" Regan said, leaning back in her chair. "It's great to hear from old friends, and it's a good way to network." </p><p> "That's why I'm calling. Regan, I really need your help." </p><p> Oh, God, Regan thought. Knowing Danny, what can he be up to now? "What's the matter?" she asked. </p><p> "I live in Las Vegas and work in television. I was asked to produce a reality show. There's a competition to see if my show will get on the air..." </p><p> Just what the world needs, Regan thought. Another reality show. </p><p> "A guy named Roscoe Parker who's been out here for years owns a local cable station called the Balloon Channel, also known as Hot Air Cable. That's because he also owns a hot air ballooning company. Anyway, he has a ton of dough. He gave me money to produce a reality show and is backing somebody else who is producing a sitcom. Both shows involve hot air balloons. This week we're putting together pilots to show Roscoe on Friday afternoon. The one he likes best he'll put on the air Friday night." </p><p> "That's competition for you," Regan commented. </p><p> "You're not kidding. Roscoe's station is small but it's growing. This is a big chance for me. If my show is chosen, I'll have a regular slot on the Balloon Channel lineup. But things have been going wrong on the set lately. Yesterday one of our cameras was stolen. Then I was filming an introduction to the show at the hot air balloon field and the platform I was standing on collapsed under me. I think someone is trying to sabotage my operation. What I was wondering is, could you come to Vegas for a few days and help me out?" </p><p> Regan was afraid to ask but somehow she managed. "What is your show about?" </p><p> "It's called <i>Love Above Sea Level. Calamine lotion for the proverbial seven-year itch."</i> </p><p> "Excuse me?" </p><p> "I wanted to create a show for married couples. So many reality shows are about singles looking for love. How about one for people who have found love and now need a little help to keep it going? We have three couples who no longer consider themselves honeymooners, to say the least, spending the week in Vegas recapturing the love they once knew. At the end of the week the advice columnists Aunt Agony and Uncle Heartburn will decide which couple truly deserves to renew their vows. We're flying to the Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Fiesta on Roscoe's private plane. We'll all go up in a hot air balloon shaped like a wedding cake as soon as the sun rises on Friday morning. With a camera, of course. The winning couple will be announced up in the air. Then they'll renew their vows and come back down to earth with a million bucks." </p><p> I have not words, Regan thought. </p><p> "Regan, are you there?" Danny asked anxiously. </p><p> "Indeed." Regan cleared her throat. "Just out of curiosity, where did you find these couples?" </p><p> "Roscoe's people found them. I guess they had plenty of folks to choose from. We wanted couples who needed our help and could benefit from a little excitement in their relationship. I see this as the only reality show that is a real positive contribution to society. If we can get just one couple to rekindle that lost spark, then we've done our job." </p><p> The thought of a million dollars would make any couple do a lot of rekindling, Regan mused. "So you want me to come to Vegas?" </p><p> "I know I can trust you." </p><p> "Really?" </p><p> "Anyone you survived grammar school with you should be able to trust. There's got to be a permanent bond between two people who sat together in the same class for eight years." </p><p> "That's true." Regan laughed. "But I have to tell you: I know at least one person from our class has served time. Credit card theft. I'd never ask him to hold my purse no matter how many years we sat together." </p><p> "Let me guess. Bobby Hastings." </p><p> "Bingo." </p><p> "Well I'm afraid there's at least one Bobby Hastings kind of character hanging around my show. And I'm afraid whoever it is is going to cause more trouble." </p><p> Regan opened the drawer of her desk and pulled out her trusty legal pad. This is what I get for signing up for that classmates website, she realized. What was the old expression...be careful what you pray for? She picked up a pen. "Okay, Danny. Let me ask you a few more questions. Then I'll call the airlines. I'm sure I can catch a plane to Vegas this afternoon. But I have to be back Friday night." </p><p> "Don't worry, Regan. By Friday the show will be finished. One way or the other." </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Carol Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>Mobility Justice: The Politics of Movement in an Age of Extremes</h2><p><b>Mobility justice is one of the crucial political and ethical issues of our day</b><p>We are in the midst of a global climate crisis and experiencing the extreme challenges of urbanization.

This one also first saw light in his grandfather&#x2019;s house, but on a far grander scale&#x2014;indeed, in the biggest private home in Britain.<br><br>Surrounded by three thousand acres of &#x201c;green lawns and shining water, banks of laurel and fern, groves of oak and cedar, fountains and islands,&#x201d; Blenheim Castle boasted 187 rooms.1 It was in a drafty bedroom on the first floor that Jennie Jerome Churchill gave birth to her first child. &#x201c;Dark eyes and hair&#x201d; was how her twenty-five-year-old husband, Randolph Churchill, described the boy to Jennie&#x2019;s mother, and &#x201c;wonderfully very pretty everybody says.&#x201d;2<br><br>The child&#x2019;s baptized name would be Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. If the Gandhis were unknown outside their tiny Indian state, the Churchill name was steeped in history. John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, had been Europe&#x2019;s most acclaimed general and the most powerful man in Britain. His series of victories over France in the first decade of the eighteenth century had made Britain a world-class power. A grateful Queen Anne gave him the royal estate at Woodstock on which to build a palace, which he named after his most famous victory. For Winston Churchill, Blenheim Castle would always symbolize a heritage of glory and a family born to greatness.<br><br>Yet the first Duke of Marlborough had been followed by a succession of nonentities. If the power and wealth of England expanded to unimagined heights over the next century, that of the Churchills steadily declined.<br><br>The vast fortune that the first duke accumulated in the age of Queen Anne was squandered by his successors. When Randolph&#x2019;s father inherited the title in 1857, the same year the Great Mutiny raged in India, he had been faced, like his father and grandfather before him, by debts of Himalayan proportions and slender means with which to meet them. Randolph&#x2019;s grandfather had already turned Blenheim into a public museum, charging visitors one shilling admission. Randolph&#x2019;s father would have to sell off priceless paintings (including a Raphael and Van Dyck&#x2019;s splendid equestrian portrait of King Charles I, still the largest painting in the National Gallery), the fabulous Marlborough collection of gems, and the eighteen-thousand-volume Sunderland library, in order to make ends meet.3<br><br>In the financial squeeze which was beginning to affect nearly all the Victorian aristocracy, the Spencer-Churchills felt the pinch more than most. For Randolph Churchill, the Marlborough legacy was a bankrupt inheritance. In a crucial sense, it was no inheritance at all. His older brother, Lord Blandford, would take over the title, Blenheim, and the remaining estates. What was left for him, and for his heirs, was relatively paltry (although much more than the patrimony of the great majority of Britons), with �4,200 a year and the lease on a house in Mayfair.4<br><br>So the new father, twenty-five-year-old Randolph, was going to have to cut his own way into the world, just as his son would. And both would choose the same way: politics.<br><br>Randolph was the family rebel, a natural contrarian and malcontent. Beneath his pale bulging eyes, large exquisite mustache, and cool aristocratic hauteur was the soul of a headstrong alpha male. As he told his friend Lord Rosebery, &#x201c;I like to be the boss.&#x201d;5 Young Lord Randolph was determined to make a name for himself as a member of Parliament. All he needed was an issue.<br><br>In 1874 an issue was not easy to find. At the time when Winston Churchill was born, British politics reflected a consensus that the country had not known in nearly a hundred years&#x2014;and soon would never know again.6 The last big domestic battle had been fought over the Second Reform Bill of 1867, when crowds in London clashed in the streets with police and tore up railings around Hyde Park. Passage of the act opened the door to Britain&#x2019;s first working-class voters. But almost a decade later neither Conservatives nor Liberals were inclined to let it swing open any wider.<br><br>Both parties agreed that free trade was the cornerstone of the British economy, still the most productive in the world. Both agreed on the importance of keeping the gold standard. They even agreed that social reform was best left in private and local hands, although Parliament would occasionally give its approval to a round of slum clearances or a comprehensive health act. A twelve-hour day for the average workman, and ten and a half hours for women and young persons older than thirteen, made eminent good sense economically and morally. Giving them a government retirement pension or an unemployment check did not.7<br><br>Tories and Liberals also agreed on maintaining an empire that was without rival and on defending it with a navy that was second to none. In 1874 that empire was not only the most extensive but the most cohesive on the planet.8 It emcompassed Britain itself, with England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland welded together under a single government and crown. Across the Atlantic there were the islands of the West Indies and also Canada, the empire&#x2019;s first self-governing &#x201c;dominion&#x201d;&#x2014;a word that would loom large in the later battles between Churchill and Gandhi.<br><br>Then there were the prosperous and stable colonies of white settlers in New Zealand and Australia which, although more than ten thousand miles away, felt a strong bond of loyalty to Britain and the Crown. Britain also directed the fate of two colonies in southern Africa, the Cape Colony and Natal, in addition to Lagos in Nigeria. Hong Kong, Singapore, and some scattered possessions in Asia and the Mediterranean completed the collection.<br><br>But the centerpiece of the empire was India, where Britain was the undisputed master of more than a quarter billion people. In 1874 two out of every three British subjects was an Indian. Since the Mutiny both political parties had closed ranks about dealing with India. The power of the British system of governance, or the Raj as it was called after the Mutiny, had become more extensive and more streamlined. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 had also made it much easier to reach the ancient subcontinent than in the days before the Mutiny.<br><br>Most Britons still knew almost nothing about the subcontinent or its peoples. Nonetheless, the fact that they possessed India, and governed it virtually as a separate empire, gave Britons a halo of superpower status that no other people or nation could match. The attitude was summed up nine years later in Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;Ave Imperatrix&#x201d;:<br><br>And all are bred to do your will<br><br>By land and sea&#x2014;wherever flies<br><br>The Flag, to fight and follow still,<br><br>And work your Empire&#x2019;s destinies.<br><br>In the midst of this triumphant march to the future, the only hint of trouble was Ireland. The question of whether the Catholic Irish would ever enjoy any degree of &#x201c;home rule&#x201d; had become a live issue in Irish politics. In 1875 it sent Charles Stewart Parnell to Parliament, but otherwise Irish nationalism hardly registered in Westminster; nor did any other issue.*<br><br>There seemed to be no burning questions to divide public opinion, no bitter clash of interests, no looming threats on the horizon for an unknown but ambitious politician to seize on. By 1880 Randolph realized he had only one way to get attention in Parliament: by becoming a nuisance and stirring things up.<br><br>The issue Winston&#x2019;s father seized upon was the Bradlaugh case. Charles Bradlaugh was a Liberal and a radical atheist who, when elected to Parliament that year, refused to take the oath of allegiance needed to take his seat in the Commons, because it contained the words &#x201c;so help me God.&#x201d; The question of whether Bradlaugh should be allowed to take his seat anyway stirred the hearts of many Conservative members, and Randolph&#x2019;s friend Sir Henry Drummond Wolff asked his help against Bradlaugh.<br><br>Randolph soon discovered that Bradlaugh made an easy target.9 He was not only a free thinker but a socialist, an advocate of birth control, and even a critic of Empire. Bradlaugh was also a radical republican who denounced the monarchy and aristocrats like Randolph in heated terms.&#x2020; So when Randolph made his speech on May 24, 1880, condemning Bradlaugh for his atheism, he also read aloud from one of Bradlaugh&#x2019;s pamphlets calling the royal family &#x201c;small German breast-beating wanderers, whose only merit is their loving hatred of one another.&#x201d; He then hurled the pamphlet on the floor and stamped on it.<br><br>The House was ecstatic. &#x201c;Everyone was full of it,&#x201d; Jennie wrote, who<br><br>* It would be registering sooner than most realized. Ironically, Kipling&#x2019;s triumphant poem was composed in 1882, after the exposure of an Irish plot to assassinate Queen Victoria, to reassure the British public. Winston Churchill&#x2019;s earliest childhood memory was of wandering through Dublin&#x2019;s Phoenix Park and seeing the point where the British viceroy had been murdered only a couple of years earlier.<br><br>&#x2020; He would also be one of the first champions of Indian nationalism. When he died in 1891 and was buried in London&#x2019;s Brookwood Cemetery, among the three thousand mourners who attended the funeral would be a young Mohandas Gandhi.<br><br>had watched the speech from the gallery, &#x201c;and rushed up and congratulated me to such an extent that I felt as though I had made it.&#x201d;10 Lord Randolph Churchill&#x2019;s career was launched as a sensational, even outrageous, headline-grabber. Together with Wolff and another friend, Sir Henry Gorst, he formed what came to be known as the Fourth Party,* a junta of Tory mavericks who ripped into their own party leaders any time they sided with the government, to the delight of journalists and newspaper readers.<br><br>Suddenly, thanks to Randolph Churchill, politics was fun again. When Bradlaugh was reelected in spite of being denied his seat, Randolph attacked him again, carefully playing it for laughs and for the gallery and the news media; when the voters of Northampton insisted on returning Bradlaugh again, Randolph did the same thing. And then a fourth and a fifth time: at one point Bradlaugh had to be escorted out of the House chamber by police and locked up in the Big Ben tower. Some people began to joke that Randolph must be bribing Northampton voters to keep voting for Bradlaugh, since they were also keeping Randolph in the headlines.11<br><br>Lord Randolph had the good sense to realize that while the Bradlaugh case had launched his political rise, he needed more substantial issues to sustain it. He tried Ireland for a while, taking up the cause of Ulster Protestants in the North and lambasting the Irish nationalists of the south. He tested a new catchphrase, &#x201c;Tory Democracy,&#x201d; urging Conservatives to win votes and allies among Britain&#x2019;s newly enfranchised working class&#x2014;but the phrase had more headline appeal than substance or thought behind it. He even tried Egypt, furiously denouncing the Liberal government&#x2019;s support of its corrupt ruler. Finally in the summer of 1884, the man an American journalist called &#x201c;the political sensation of England&#x201d; turned to India.<br><br>Crucial though India was to the empire, few politicians had any expertise in the empire&#x2019;s greatest possession. In November 1884 Churchill planned a major tour of India. His friend Wilfred Blunt, who had already traveled widely there, set up the key introductions. He predicted &#x201c;a great future for any statesman who will preach Tory Democracy in India.&#x201d;12 Lord Randolph left in December and did not return to London until April 1885, after logging more than 22,800 miles. He then delivered a round of fiery speeches denouncing the Gladstone government&#x2019;s<br><br>* After the Liberals, Tories, and Irish Nationalists.<br><br>policies there, from neglecting the threat from Russia to failing to gain more native participation in the Raj. The speeches established him as the Conservatives&#x2019; &#x201c;front line spokesman on India.&#x201d;13 So when they returned to power in June that year, he was the obvious candidate for secretary of state for India.<br><br>In terms of direct influence over people&#x2019;s lives, it was the single most powerful position in the cabinet, even more powerful than prime minister. At age thirty-six, Randolph Churchill would be overseeing an imperial domain that was, as he discovered in his travels and readings, unique in British history&#x2014;perhaps unique in human history.<br>How the British built an empire in India, conquering one of the most ancient and powerful civilizations in the world, is an epic of heroism, sacrifice, ruthlessness, and greed. But it is also the story of a growing sense of mission, even destiny: the growing conviction that the British were meant to rule India not only for their own interests but for the sake of the Indians as well. That belief would decisively shape the character not only of the British Empire in India but also of Randolph&#x2019;s son Winston Churchill&#x2014;the man into whose hands the destiny of the Raj would ultimately fall.<br><br>Ironically, that empire&#x2019;s founding fathers, the group of God-fearing merchants living in Shakespeare&#x2019;s London who created the Honorable East India Company, never intended to go to India at all&#x2014;any more than Queen Elizabeth I did when she gave them a royal charter on the last day of 1600. Their aim was to get to the Spice Islands (the Molucca Islands in today&#x2019;s Indonesia), where Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch merchants and adventurers were battling over fortunes in nutmeg, cloves, and mace. The East India Company&#x2019;s initial stop at Surat, on India&#x2019;s west coast, was supposed to be only a layover for ventures farther east.<br><br>But when the Dutch tortured and murdered ten of their merchants in the island of Amboyne in 1623 and foisted the English out of the Spice Islands, the London-based company had nowhere else to go.14 By 1650, the year John Churchill was born in Devon, the East India Company found itself precariously perched in a tiny settlement near Surat called Fort St. George, doing business at the pleasure of the rulers of India, the Mughal emperors&#x2014;at the time probably the richest human beings in the world. In 1674 the company acquired a similar outpost at Bombay, which King Charles II had received as a wedding present from the king of Portugal. Then in 1690 it built another, in Bengal at Kalikat, which the English pronounced Calcutta.</p><h2>Long Gone: A Novel of Suspense</h2><p><p>&#x201c;<em>Long Gone</em> is a tremendous novel, and Alafair Burke is one of the finest young crime writers working today.&#x201d;<br>--Dennis Lehane, author of <em>Moonlight Mile </em></p><p>Echoing the intensity of Harlan Coben&#x2019;s <em>Tell No One</em> and the psychological depth of Laura Lippman&#x2019;s <em>What the Dead Know</em>, Alafair Burke&#x2019;s first stand-alone novel catapults her into the top ranks of modern suspense.

It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.</p> <p>Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. With <em>Long Gone</em> she makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.</p> <p>At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&#x2019;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&#x2019;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.</p> <p>I am familiar with most of Burke&#x2019;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&#x2019;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know. She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.</p> <p>That is the writer&#x2019;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&#x2019;t we all wish we were the same.</p> <p>Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud. Start spreading the news.</p><p>After months of struggling, Alice Humphrey finally lands her dream job managing a trendy new Manhattan art gallery.

What do these occult origins of modern science tell us about the universe today? The Forbidden Universe reveals the secret brotherhood that defined the world, and perhaps discovered the mind of God. All the pioneers of science, from Copernicus to Newton via Galileo, were inspired by Hermeticism. Men such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Bacon, Kepler, Tycho Brahe - even Shakespeare - owed much of their achievements to basically occult beliefs - the hermetica. In this fascinating study, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince go in search of the Hermetic origins of modern science and prove that not everything is as it seems and that over the past 400 years there has been a secret agenda behind our search for truth. From the age of Leonardo da Vinci, the influence of hermetic thinking upon the greatest minds in history has been hidden, a secret held by a forbidden brotherhood in search of the mind of God. Yet this search does not end in history but can be found in the present day - in the contemporary debates of leading evolutionists and thinkers. The significance of this hidden school can hardly be over-emphasised. Not only did it provide a spiritual and philosophical background to the rise of modern science, but its worldview is also relevant to those hungry for all sorts of knowledge even in the twenty-first century. And it may even show the way to reconciling the apparently irreconcilable divide between the scientific and the spiritual. Picknett and Prince go in search of this true foundation of modern rational thought and reveal a story that overturns 400 years of received wisdom.</p><p>Lynn Picknett is author of Mary Magdalene: Christianity&#39;s Hidden Goddess and (with Clive Prince) Turin Shroud: How Leonardo da Vinci Fooled History and its sequel, The Templar Revelation. She is also a lecturer and consultant on UFOs and the paranormal (Meridien/Anglia TV, Talk Radio, LBC, the Museum of Photography and the British UFO Research Association).

Paul wrote about them at length (and depth) in his letter to the Christians at Colossae, where certain new teachers were proclaiming that &#34;mere Christianity&#34; is not enough. There is, they suggested, a fuller experience, a greater liberation, than they had so far enjoyed. But Paul was adamant: all God&#39;s fullness is in Christ alone, and only through his complete work are we set free. These are the great objective truths of the faith that Dick Lucas highlights in his exposition, enabling us to see both the riches that are ours in Christ and the irrelevance--even blasphemy--of all would-be improvements on what God has done.</p><p>Lucas was rector of St. Helen&#39;s Bishopsgate, London.</p><h2>Corridors of the Night: A William Monk Novel</h2><p>Anne Perry, that incomparable novelist of life in Victorian England, has once again surpassed herself, with this twenty-first installment of her <i>New York Times</i> bestselling William Monk series.

Even the windows on the wards would be shut at this hour.<br><br>The girl stood motionless. Her eyes were wide, her skin as pale as the nightgown that hung just past her knees. Her legs were matchstick thin and her feet bare and dusty. She looked terrified.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you lost?&#x201d; Hester asked her gently. She could not think what the child was doing here. This was an annex to Greenwich Hospital. It backed onto the Thames, well downriver from the huge Port of London and the teeming city beyond. Did she belong to one of the other nurses, who had sneaked her in rather than leave her alone at home? It was against the rules. Hester would have to make sure no one else found her.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, miss,&#x201d; the child said in a hoarse whisper. &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s dying! You gotter come an&#x2019; &#x2019;elp &#x2019;im. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>There was no other sound in the night, no footsteps on the stone floors. Dr. Rand would not be on duty until the morning.<br><br>The child&#x2019;s fear vibrated in the air. &#x201c;Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; Hester asked quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;<br><br>The child gulped and took a deep breath. &#x201c; &#x2019;E&#x2019;s this way. I left the door stuck. We can get back, if yer &#x2019;urry. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; Hester agreed. &#x201c;You lead the way. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maggie.&#x201d; She turned and started to go quickly, her bare feet soundless on the chill floor.<br><br>Hester followed her down the corridor, around a corner, and along another passage even less well lit. She could only just see the small, pale figure ahead of her, glancing backwards every few moments to make sure Hester was still there. They were going away from the wards where sick and badly injured sailors were treated, and farther into administrative areas and storerooms. Hester did not know the hospital well. She had volunteered to do temporary night duty as a favor to Jenny Solway, a friend who had a sudden illness in her own family. They had served together with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea. That was almost fourteen years ago, but the experiences they had shared&#x2014;on fearful battlefields, including Balaclava, and in the hospital in Sebastopol&#x2014;forged their lasting friendship, still strong although they went years without meeting.<br><br>Hester caught up with the child and took her small, cold hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;To &#x2019;elp Charlie,&#x201d; Maggie replied without turning her head. She was tugging at Hester now. &#x201c;We gotter &#x2019;urry. Please . . .&#x201d;<br><br>One more turn in the corridor and they reached a door that was flush with the wall and appeared to have no handle. A piece of cotton knotted to make a short rope was wedged to stop the door from closing completely. Maggie let go of Hester&#x2019;s hand, slid her thin fingers under the fabric, and eased the door open.<br><br>&#x201c;Ssh!&#x201d; she warned. Then she stepped sideways through the crack and beckoned for Hester to follow her. When Hester was through also, she replaced the rope and then pushed the door closed again.<br><br>Hester went in a step behind Maggie. They were in another ward, smaller than the ones for the sailors, but holding six cots. The night lamps on the walls showed that there were small forms in three of them, lying still, as if asleep.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; Hester whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;This is our place,&#x201d; Maggie replied. &#x201c;Charlie&#x2019;s over there.&#x201d; She took Hester&#x2019;s hand again and pulled her toward the farthest bed near the doorway of the ward. It was closed, and Hester had lost her sense of direction to know even which way it faced.<br><br>Maggie stopped beside the bed, where an ashen-skinned boy about her own size lay propped up against the pillows. He turned toward her very slightly and tried to smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Charlie,&#x201d; Maggie&#x2019;s voice wobbled a little and there were tears on her cheeks, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s going to be all right. I got one o&#x2019; the nurses ter come. She&#x2019;s gonna make yer better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yer shouldn&#x2019;t a&#x2019; done that,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Yer&#x2019;ll get into trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her chin up a little. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care!&#x201d; She looked at Hester. &#x201c;Yer gotta do summink.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s heart sank and she felt a moment of panic. The boy looked desperately ill. Maggie was probably right that he was dying. Was this a quarantine ward? How could she hope to get enough information from a young child to have any idea what was wrong with him, or how to help?<br><br>The first thing she needed to do was to reassure him, gain his confidence. She moved forward and stood by the side of the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Charlie,&#x201d; she said very quietly. &#x201c;Tell me how you feel. Are you hot? Sick? Shivery? Do you hurt anywhere especially?&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at her for a moment. His face was so pale his skin looked almost translucent, the shadows around his eyes like bruises. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really &#x2019;urt,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Just a bit achy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you been sick?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very sick, or just a little?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you eaten anything since then?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Drink anything? Water?&#x201d;<br><br>She reached forward and touched her hand to his forehead. He felt hot and dry. She turned to Maggie, who was staring at her, eyes filled with fear.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you go and fetch Charlie a drink of water, please?&#x201d; Hester asked.<br><br>Maggie started to speak, then changed her mind and went off to obey.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, miss, don&#x2019;t tell &#x2019;er I&#x2019;m dyin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Charlie said almost under his breath. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d be awful upset.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester felt a sudden ache in her throat. She was a nurse&#x2014;she was used to people dying&#x2014;but these children alone, with no parent to comfort them, were different. They were so small, and lost. She did not normally lie to patients; if you did, then sooner or later they stopped believing you, and if that happened, much of the power to help was lost too.<br><br>This was different.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She made too big a promise, without hesitation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend to let you die if I can help it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But will you look after &#x2019;er?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;An&#x2019; Mike? Please?&#x201d;<br><br>It was not a time for equivocation. &#x201c;Yes, I will. Are you the eldest?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;m seven. Maggie&#x2019;s only six, although she acts like she&#x2019;s everybody&#x2019;s ma.&#x201d; He gave a weak smile, a little lopsided.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know why you&#x2019;re here in hospital?&#x201d; It was time to be practical.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He shook his head a fraction. &#x201c;Summink ter do wi&#x2019; me blood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are they giving you medicine for it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They keep putting a big needle in me arm. It &#x2019;urts a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really? Yes, it would hurt. Does this needle have a glass tube on the other end of it?&#x201d; She was picturing the major new invention called a syringe, which could transfer liquids into the flesh&#x2014;or, for that matter, take them out.<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what was in the glass part?&#x201d;<br><br>He was looking paler and she could hardly hear his voice when he answered, &#x201c;Looked red, like blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie came back with a mug full of water. Hester thanked her for it, then took a sip. It smelled and tasted fresh. She put an arm around Charlie. She could feel his bones through his nightshirt. She eased him upright and helped him to very slowly drink a little of the water. When he had taken all he could she laid him back down again, then as carefully as possible straightened the sheets around him so they were smooth. He was gasping for breath, exhausted. She looked at him and was very afraid Maggie was right.<br><br>If he died, how was she going to help Maggie, who looked not much stronger herself? It was probably only fear and the need to believe she was doing something to help her brother that kept her upright on her feet, albeit swaying a little. Hester would have suggested the child sleep for a while, but she knew that if Charlie died when she was not there, the guilt would be with Maggie forever. It made no sense, but she would believe that she could have done something. In her place Hester would feel the same.<br><br>&#x201c;How old is Mike?&#x201d; she asked quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;Four,&#x201d; Maggie replied. &#x201c; &#x2019;E&#x2019;s not so bad. Maybe &#x2019;e&#x2019;ll get worse when &#x2019;e&#x2019;s older.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not. Do they put the needles into him, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She nodded again. &#x201c;But mostly Charlie. Can&#x2019;t you do summink, miss?&#x201d;<br><br>Hester still had little idea what was wrong with any of them. A misjudged treatment could be lethal. There was a stage in an illness when there was nothing more anyone could do. A small boy could take only so much &#x201c;treatment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is the doctor doing to help him? Tell me all you know, Maggie. I need to do the right thing for him.&#x201d;<br><br>The tears spilled over and ran down Maggie&#x2019;s cheeks. &#x201c; &#x2019;E don&#x2019;t do nothing, miss. &#x2019;E comes and puts a needle into Charlie, an&#x2019; &#x2019;e gets sleepy an&#x2019; sick. &#x2019;E just lies there. Can&#x2019;t even speak ter me an&#x2019; Mike. Please, miss . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Hester knew that Dr. Rand went home at night. After all, everyone had to sleep. But there was supposed to be a senior nurse on duty all night. Where was she? Sometimes there were emergencies that only a doctor could deal with, and a messenger would have to be sent to waken him. But this was a hospital for those who were extremely ill, or so badly wounded that often there was nothing that could be done for them except ease their distress, or at the very least, not leave them to die alone.<br><br>That was all too often what military nursing had been during the Crimean War, not so very long ago. Hemorrhage, gangrene, raging fever&#x2014;these were things she had been used to coping with because scores of men, even hundreds, were wounded in battle. There were too few doctors, and usually too little time. That was one of the reasons the two Rand brothers, Dr. Magnus Rand and his elder brother, a chemist, Hamilton Rand, had been so pleased to have Hester, another Crimea nurse, fill in for Jenny Solway. Her experience was of great value.<br><br>Where on earth was the nurse in charge here? Hester did not dare leave Charlie to look for her. Was she ill herself? Or passed out drunk somewhere? It had been known to happen.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what his illness is called?&#x201d; Hester asked Maggie.<br><br>Maggie shook her head no.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have the same illness?&#x201d; Hester persisted.<br><br>Maggie nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;What does the doctor do for you?&#x201d;<br><br>There was little time. In the bed beside them Charlie was lying motionless, his face white and his breathing shallow. But she had to find out all that Maggie could tell her before she attempted to help.<br><br>&#x201c;Maggie?&#x201d; she prompted.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;E pricked me wi&#x2019; the needle too.&#x201d; She took a deep breath. &#x201c;It hurt something awful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what was in the little bottle at the end of the needle?&#x201d; Hester asked. &#x201c;What color was it?&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want ter look, an&#x2019; &#x2019;e told me not ter, but I did, just quickly. I think it were blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester felt a chill run through her. So Magnus was taking blood? What for? Was Hamilton Rand testing it for something? He was a brilliant chemist, almost visionary in some ways. What was he learning from these children&#x2019;s blood?<br><br>Maggie was staring at her, waiting, her eyes full of hope.<br><br>&#x201c;Get me another cup of water,&#x201d; Hester said to her. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie turned and went immediately.<br><br>Hester leaned forward and pushed the sleeve up a little on Charlie&#x2019;s thin arm. She took the skin between her finger and thumb. It lifted away as if there were no flesh over the bone. At least she knew something to start with. &#x201c;When did you last go to a bathroom to pee?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Charlie blinked slowly. He seemed a little embarrassed. &#x201c;Long time ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you let me look inside your mouth? Please?&#x201d; He dropped his jaw obediently. She bent and peered inside. His skin was pale and almost dry, even his tongue. Now she knew at least one thing seriously wrong with him. Dehydration, when it was bad enough, could kill, especially a child as slight as he was. Water might not be all he needed, but it might keep him alive long enough to find a proper solution.<br><br>Maggie came back, running so quickly she almost tripped. She steadied herself without dropping the water, though the mug she carried was full to the brim.<br><br>Hester smiled at her, and very gently lifted Charlie up again so he was cradled in her arms and his head was nearly upright. He opened his eyes, but it was Maggie he looked at. He smiled at her hazily, and then seemed to drift off.<br><br>Hester put the mug to his lips. &#x201c;Drink a little more, Charlie,&#x201d; she urged him. &#x201c;Just a sip.&#x201d;<br><br>For several moments he did not move; then, as he tipped the mug very slightly, he took a mouthful.

When the neighbors camp out overnight, the protagonist gets his first glimpse of Claudia, an older girl who asks him to spy on her uncle Ra�l.<br> In the second section, the protagonist is the writer of the story begun in the first section. His father is a man of few words who claims to be apolitical but who quietly sympathized&#x2015;to what degree, the author isn't sure&#x2015;with the Pinochet regime. His reflections on the progress of the novel and on his own life&#x2015;which is strikingly similar to the life of his novel's protagonist&#x2015;expose the raw suture of fiction and reality.<br> <i>Ways of Going Home</i> switches between author and character, past and present, reflecting with melancholy and rage on the history of a nation and on a generation born too late&#x2015;the generation which, as the author-narrator puts it, learned to read and write while their parents became accomplices or victims. It is the most personal novel to date from Zambra, the most important Chilean author since Roberto Bola�o.</p></p><p><b>Alejandro Zambra</b> is a poet, novelist, and literary critic who was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1975. He is the author of two previous novels, <i>The Private Lives of Trees </i>and <i>Bonsai</i>, which was awarded a Chilean Critics Award for best novel. He was selected as one of <i>Granta</i>'s Best of Young Spanish-Language Novelists and was elected to the Bogot�-39 list. <b>Megan McDowell</b> is a literary translator living in Zurich, Switzerland. She also translated Alejandro Zambra's <i>The Private Lives of Trees</i>.SECONDARY CHARACTERS <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Once, I got lost. I was six or seven. I got distracted, and all of a sudden I couldn&#x2019;t see my parents anymore. I was scared, but I immediately found the way home and got there before they did. They kept looking for me, desperate, but I thought that they were lost. That I knew how to get home and they didn&#x2019;t. <br>&#x201c;You went a different way,&#x201d; my mother said later, angry, her eyes still swollen. <br>You were the ones who went a different way, I thought, but I didn&#x2019;t say it. <br>Dad watched quietly from the armchair. Sometimes I think he spent all his time just sitting there, thinking. But maybe he didn&#x2019;t really think about anything. Maybe he just closed his eyes and received the present with calm or resignation. That night he spoke, though: &#x201c;This is a good thing,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;You overcame adversity.&#x201d; Mom looked at him suspiciously, but he went on stringing together a confused speech about adversity. <br>I lay back on the chair across from him and pretended to fall asleep. I heard them argue, always the same pattern. Mom would say five sentences and Dad would answer with a single word. Sometimes he would answer sharply: &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Sometimes he would say, practically shouting: &#x201c;Liar.&#x201d; Sometimes he would even say, like the police: &#x201c;Negative.&#x201d; <br>That night Mom carried me to bed and told me, perhaps knowing I was only pretending to sleep and was listening, curious and attentive: &#x201c;Your father is right. Now we know you won&#x2019;t get lost. That you know how to walk in the street alone. But you should concentrate more on the way. You should walk faster.&#x201d; <br>I listened to her. From then on, I walked faster. In fact, a couple of years later, the first time I talked to Claudia, she asked me why I walked so fast. She had been following me for days, spying on me. We had met not long before, on March 3, 1985&#x2014;the night of the earthquake&#x2014;but we hadn&#x2019;t talked then. <br>She was twelve and I was nine, so our friendship was impossible. But we were friends, or something like it. We talked a lot. Sometimes I think I&#x2019;m writing this book just to remember those conversations. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The night of the earthquake I was scared but I also, in a way, enjoyed what was happening. <br>In the front yard of one of the houses, the adults put up two tents for the children to sleep in, and at first it was chaos because we all wanted to sleep in the one that looked like an igloo&#x2014;those were still a novelty back then&#x2014;but they gave that one to the girls. So we boys shut ourselves in to fight in silence, which was what we did when we were alone: hit each other furiously, happily. But then the redhead&#x2019;s nose started bleeding, so we had to find another game. <br>Someone thought of making wills, and at first it seemed like a good idea; after a while, though, we decided it didn&#x2019;t make sense, because if a bigger earthquake came and ended the world, there wouldn&#x2019;t be anyone to leave our things to. Then we imagined that the earth was like a dog shaking itself so people fell off like fleas into space, and we thought about that image so much it made us laugh, and it also made us sleepy. <br>But I didn&#x2019;t want to sleep. I was tired like never before, but it was a new tiredness that burned my eyes. I decided to stay up all night and I tried to sneak into the igloo to keep talking to the girls, but the policeman&#x2019;s daughter threw me out, saying I wanted to rape them. Back then I didn&#x2019;t know what a rapist was but I still promised I didn&#x2019;t want to rape them, I just wanted to look at them, and she laughed mockingly and replied that that was what rapists always said. I had to stay outside, listening to them pretend that their dolls were the only survivors; they mourned their owners, crying spectacularly when they realized they were dead, although one of them thought it was for the best, since the human race had always seemed repellent to her. Finally, they argued over who would be in charge. The discussion seemed long to me, but it was easily resolved, since there was only one original Barbie among the dolls: she won. <br>I found a beach chair among the rubble and shyly approached the adults&#x2019; bonfire. It was strange to see the neighbors all gathered together, maybe for the first time ever. They drowned their fear in cups of wine and long looks of complicity. Someone brought an old wooden table and threw it casually on the fire. &#x201c;If you want, I&#x2019;ll throw the guitar on, too,&#x201d; said Dad, and everyone laughed, even me, though I was a little disconcerted because Dad didn&#x2019;t usually tell jokes. That&#x2019;s when our neighbor Ra�l returned, and Magali and Claudia were with him. &#x201c;These are my sister and my niece,&#x201d; he said. After the earthquake he had gone to look for them, and now he was coming back, visibly relieved. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Ra�l was the only person in the neighborhood who lived alone. It was hard for me to understand how someone could live alone. I thought that being alone was a kind of punishment or disease. <br>The morning he arrived with a mattress strapped to the roof of his old Fiat 500, I asked my mother when the rest of his family would come; she answered sweetly that not everyone had family. Then I thought we should help him, but after a while I caught on, surprised, that my parents weren&#x2019;t interested in helping Ra�l; they didn&#x2019;t think it was necessary and they even felt a certain reluctance toward that young, thin man. We were neighbors, we shared a wall and a privet hedge, but there was an enormous distance separating us. <br>It was said around the neighborhood that Ra�l was a Christian Democrat, and that struck me as interesting. It&#x2019;s hard to explain now why a nine-year-old boy would be interested that someone was a Christian Democrat. Maybe I thought there was some connection between being a Christian Democrat and the sad circumstance of living alone. I had never seen Dad speak to Ra�l, so I was surprised to see them sharing a few cigarettes that night. I thought they must be talking about solitude, that Dad was giving our neighbor advice about how to overcome solitude, though Dad must have known very little about the subject. <br>Magali, meanwhile, was holding Claudia tightly in a corner, away from the group. The two of them seemed uncomfortable. I remember thinking that they must have been uncomfortable because they were different from the rest of the people gathered there. Politely, but perhaps with a trace of malice, one neighbor asked Magali what she did for a living; Magali answered immediately, as if she&#x2019;d been expecting the question, that she was an English teacher. <br>It was very late and I was sent to bed. I had to reluctantly make space for myself in the tent. I was afraid I might fall asleep, but I distracted myself by listening to those stray voices in the night. I understood that Ra�l had taken his relatives home, because people started to talk about them. Someone said the girl was strange. She hadn&#x2019;t seemed strange to me. She had seemed beautiful. &#x201c;And the woman,&#x201d; said my mother, &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t have an English teacher&#x2019;s face.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She had the face of a housewife, nothing more,&#x201d; added another neighbor, and they drew out the joke for a while. <br>I thought about an English teacher&#x2019;s face, about what an English teacher&#x2019;s face should be like. I thought about my mother, my father. I thought: What kinds of faces do my parents have? But our parents never really have faces. We never learn to truly look at them. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I thought we would spend weeks or even months outside, waiting for some far-off truck to bring supplies and blankets. I even imagined myself talking on TV, thanking my fellow Chileans for their help, the way I&#x2019;d seen people do during the rainstorms. I thought about the terrible floods of other years, when we couldn&#x2019;t go out and we were practically obligated to sit in front of the screen and watch the people who had lost everything. <br>But it wasn&#x2019;t like that. Calm returned almost immediately. The worst always happened to other people. In that lost corner west of Santiago the earthquake had been no more than an enormous scare. A few shacks fell down, but there was no great damage and no one died. The TV showed the San Antonio port destroyed, as well as some streets I had seen or thought I had seen on rare trips to downtown Santiago. I confusedly intuited that the true suffering happened there. <br>If there was anything to learn, we didn&#x2019;t learn it. Now I think it&#x2019;s a good thing to lose confidence in the solidity of the ground, I think it&#x2019;s necessary to know that from one moment to the next everything can come tumbling down. But at the time we went back, just like that, to life as usual. <br>Once we were back in the house, Dad confirmed that the damage was slight: just some plaster fallen from the walls and a cracked window. Mom mourned only the loss of the zodiac glasses. Eight of them broke, including hers (Pisces), Dad&#x2019;s (Leo), and the one Grandma used when she came to see us (Scorpio). <br>&#x201c;No problem, we have other glasses, we don&#x2019;t need any more,&#x201d; said Dad, and she answered without looking at him, looking at me: &#x201c;Only yours survived.&#x201d; Then she went to get the glass with the Libra sign, and gave it to me with a solemn gesture. She spent the following days a little depressed, contemplating giving the remaining glasses to Geminis, Virgos, Aquarians. <br>The good news was that we wouldn&#x2019;t go back to school right away. The old building had suffered significant damage, and those who had seen it said it was a pile of rubble. It was hard for me to imagine the school destroyed, though it wasn&#x2019;t sadness that I felt. I just felt curious. I especially remembered the bare spot at the edge of the playground where we went at recess, and the wall the middle school kids would scribble on. I thought about all those messages smashed to smithereens, scattered in the ash on the ground&#x2014;bawdy sayings, phrases for or against Colo-Colo, or for or against Pinochet. One phrase I found especially funny: <i>Pinochet sucks dick.</i> <br>Back then I was, as I always have been, and I always will be, for Colo-Colo. As for Pinochet, to me he was a television personality who hosted a show with no fixed schedule, and I hated him for that, for the stuffy national channels that interrupted their programming during the best parts. Later I hated him for being a son of a bitch, for being a murderer, but back then I hated him only for those inconvenient shows that Dad watched without saying a word, without acceding any movement other than a more forceful drag on the cigarette he always had glued to his lips. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Around then, the redhead&#x2019;s father took a trip to Miami, and he returned with a baseball glove and bat for his son. The gift brought about an unexpected break in our routine. For many days we switched from soccer to that slow and slightly stupid game which nevertheless entranced my friends. It was absurd: ours must have been the only neighborhood in the country where the kids played baseball instead of soccer. It was hard for me to hit the ball or throw it straight and I was quickly sent to the bench. The redhead, who had been one of my best friends, suddenly became popular. Now he preferred the company of the older kids who were attracted by the foreign game and had joined our group. And that&#x2019;s how, because of baseball, I was left friendless. <br>In the afternoons, resigned to solitude, I would leave the house, as they say, to tire myself out: I walked in wider and wider circuits, though I almost always respected a certain geometry of circles. I exhausted all possible routes, all the blocks, took in new landscapes, though the world didn&#x2019;t vary too much: the same new houses, built quickly, as if obeying some urgency, but nevertheless solid and resilient. In a few weeks most of the walls had been restored and reinforced. It was hard to tell there had just been an earthquake. <br>Now I don&#x2019;t understand that freedom we enjoyed. We lived under a dictatorship; people talked about crimes and attacks, martial law and curfew, but even so, nothing kept me from spending all day wandering far from home. Weren&#x2019;t the streets of Maip� dangerous then? At night they were, and during the day as well, but the adults played, arrogantly or innocently&#x2014;or with a mixture of arrogance and innocence&#x2014;at ignoring the danger. They played at thinking that discontent was a thing of the poor and power the domain of the rich, and in those streets no one was poor or rich, at least not yet. <br>One of those afternoons I saw Ra�l&#x2019;s niece again, but I didn&#x2019;t know if I should say hello. I saw her again several times in the following days. I didn&#x2019;t realize that she was actually following me. <br>&#x201c;I just like to walk fast,&#x201d; I answered when she finally spoke to me, and then came a long silence that she broke by asking me if I was lost. I answered that no, I knew perfectly well how to get home. &#x201c;It was a joke, I want to talk to you, let&#x2019;s meet next Monday at five in the supermarket bakery.&#x201d; She said it like that, in one sentence, and left. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The next day my parents woke me up early because we were going to spend the weekend at Lo Ovalle Reservoir. Mom didn&#x2019;t want to go and she dragged out the preparations, confident that lunchtime would come and the plan would have to change. Dad decided, however, that we would have lunch at a restaurant, and we left right away. Back then, it was a real luxury to eat out. I sat in the backseat of the Peugeot thinking about what I would order, and in the end I asked for a steak <i>a lo pobre</i>. Dad warned me that it was a big dish and I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to eat it all, but on those rare outings I was free to order whatever I wanted. <br>Suddenly, that heavy atmosphere prevailed in which the only possible topic of conversation is the lateness of the food. Our order took so long that finally Dad decided we would leave as soon as the food came. I protested, or I wanted to protest, or now I think I should have protested. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to leave, let&#x2019;s go now,&#x201d; said Mom resignedly, but Dad explained that this way the restaurant owners would lose the food, that it was an act of justice, of revenge. <br>We continued our journey ill-humored and hungry. I didn&#x2019;t really like going to the reservoir. They wouldn&#x2019;t let me wander very far by myself and I got bored, though I tried to have fun swimming for a while, fleeing from the rats that lived among the rocks, looking at the worms eating the sawdust and the fish dying on land. Dad settled in to fish all day, and Mom spent the day watching him, and I watched Dad fish and Mom watch him and it was hard for me to understand how that was, for them, fun. <br>Sunday morning I faked a cold because I wanted to sleep a little longer. They went off to the rocks after giving me endless superfluous instructions. A little while later, I got up and turned on the tape player so I could listen to Raphael while I made breakfast. It was a cassette of all his best songs that my mother had recorded from the radio. Unfortunately, my finger slipped and I pressed &#x201c;REC&#x201d; for a few seconds. I ruined the tape right in the chorus of the song &#x201c;Que sabe nadie.&#x201d; <br>I was desperate. After thinking a bit, I decided the only solution was to sing over the chorus, and I started practicing the lyric, disguising my voice in a way that seemed convincing to me. Finally I decided to record. I listened to the results several times, thinking, somewhat self-indulgently, that it was good enough. I was a little worried, though, about the lack of music during those seconds. <br>My father would yell at me, but he didn&#x2019;t hit. He never hit me, it wasn&#x2019;t his style; he preferred the grandiloquence of phrases that were impressive at first, because he said them seriously, like an acto...</p><h2>A Fatal Obsession: A gripping crime thriller for fans of Ann Cleeves and Elly Griffiths (Ryder and Loveday) (Book 1)</h2><p><p><b>The start of a brand new series from the global bestselling author of the DI Hillary Greene series.<br></b></p><p>Oxford, 1960.

Among its contents are three previously uncollected stories, as well as the celebrated semi-autobiographical sequence about Linnet Muir&#x2014;stories that are wise, funny, and full of insight into the perils and promise of growing up and breaking loose.</p><p>Mavis Gallant&nbsp;was born in Montreal and worked as a journalist at the Montreal Standard before moving to Europe to devote herself to writing fiction.

New York Review Books Classics has published previous collections of Gallant's stories,&nbsp;<i>Paris Stories</i>, selected and introduced by Michael Ondaatje (2002), and<i>&nbsp;The Cost of Living.</i>&#x201c;Often, her fiction drew its energy from contradictory qualities: her stories were minutely observed but also suspenseful, matter-of-fact but also fanciful, reportorial but also imaginative.

A wife, mom, amateur chef, Fix-It Mistress, and cider enthusiast, she earned her MA in English Literature and serves on her local library&#x2019;s board of directors.Luck, Love &amp; Lemon Pie Chapter One<p></p> <br><br> <br>It took MJ one hour forty-seven minutes and three old-fashioneds to eat the entire anniversary pie herself. All that remained in the empty tin were a few smudges of lemon cream sprinkled with flakes of crust, but her stomach didn&#x2019;t seem to mind the alarming influx of calories. She waved to the nearby waiter to order another cocktail and have the pie tin removed. In minutes, the gluttonous evidence had vanished and she sipped her next drink, letting the brandy burn as it went down&#x2014;and appreciating that it was more booze than soda. Somehow, bartenders always knew when to give a generous pour.<br> <br>Fellow patrons had arrived, dined, and left, all while she had waited for Chris. She sat alone on the small patio behind their favorite local restaurant. The late-summer sun found the first changing leaves in the nearby trees that lined the meandering stream below the deck, speckling the few afternoon diners who shared the patio, finishing their bowls of handmade pasta. A waiter peeked around the corner, clearly checking to see if she was ready to pay her bill. She knew he wanted her to leave soon so he could collect his tip, but now she was too tipsy to drive herself home. Time to hydrate.<br> <br>MJ reached for her phone on the edge of the small table but missed on the first attempt. With a shaky swipe across the screen, she saw the time. Three thirty. She sent him a quick, fairly passive-aggressive text.<br> <br>Still at restaurant. Sorry you couldn&#x2019;t make it.<br> <br>Chris was supposed to have met her three hours ago for lunch, but he had never appeared, so she&#x2019;d eaten without him.<br> <br>Again.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until the server had appeared with the pie that MJ had remembered special-ordering it for today&#x2019;s lunch. She&#x2019;d called the chef weeks ago to arrange for her to make this particular pie and serve it at lunch, when Chris wouldn&#x2019;t be expecting it. For anniversaries past, Chris had always baked it, but last year he had said he didn&#x2019;t have time. So after twenty years, she decided it was her turn to bake. She&#x2019;d attempted and failed to make it three times before accepting her culinary limits, and gave his recipe to the chef. It was meant to be a surprise, a romantic gesture on their twentieth anniversary&#x2014;a celebration. Instead, alone, she had grabbed the pie and a fork and settled into her dining chair, mollifying her disappointment one flaky bite at a time, ignoring the judgey looks of the other restaurant guests.<br> <br>She set her half-empty old-fashioned on the cleared table and rested in her chair, embracing the rare afternoon solitude and booze-induced tipsiness. With her right thumb, she rubbed the inside of her left wrist where a tiny faded tree marred the thin skin. Covering an area no bigger than a dime, the scraggly ink branches were dotted with tiny purple-pink flowers as familiar to her as the sound of her children thumping through the house. Her head rested on the deck railing behind her chair, and her eyes drooped closed behind her large sunglasses as she relished the sun soaking into her skin.<br> <br><br> <br>Nineteen years ago, she had come home to an apartment glowing with enough candles to trigger a flash of worry about their cost. Scents of lemon and recently extinguished matches mingled to set her at ease as MJ kicked off her shoes with a sigh and yanked off her too-tight control-top panty hose, her skin prickling with relief. Leaving the offending items by the door with her purse and keys, she scampered to the kitchen with a quick adjustment to her lace underwear, noticing the freshly vacuumed carpet.<br> <br>Still wearing his suit, Chris stood at the kitchen counter spreading the last swirl of whipped cream onto the top of a pie. She hugged him from behind, wrapping her arms around his taut torso, her nose buried in the back of his shirt, inhaling the smell of Chris. It wasn&#x2019;t just his deodorant or shampoo or the dryer sheets she used, but a little bit of everything combined with him to create a scent that was indescribable and uniquely Chris. She could pick him out in a pitch-black room by that scent alone. When he was gone on overnights for work, she&#x2019;d wear a dirty shirt from the hamper just to smell him near her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy anniversary,&#x201d; MJ whispered in his ear.<br> <br>Chris turned in her arms, still holding the spatula covered in whipped cream.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just in time, Moon,&#x201d; he said, tapping the spatula on her lips. But before she could lick them clean, he leaned down for a kiss, the whipped cream sweetening the moment.<br> <br>MJ pulled back, sucking the remaining cream off her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what did you make?&#x201d; she asked. Chris was the cook in their marriage, conjuring up delicious creations for the two of them.<br> <br>Chris tilted his head and smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lemon custard pie.&#x201d;<br> <br>MJ leaned to look around him at the dessert.<br> <br>&#x201c;The lemon custard pie?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It seemed like the right way to celebrate our first anniversary.&#x201d;<br> <br>MJ put her hands on each side of Chris&#x2019;s face. Every fiber of her wanted to flip with giddiness that she had found the very best man to marry. His faded blue eyes brightened as they soaked up her smitten face. He completed her, filling up the empty cracks from her childhood, convincing her that marital bliss could be hers, that happy endings were possible.<br> <br><br> <br>Oh, how times had changed. As MJ drifted off in the afternoon sun, the table wobbled and a hand skimmed up her bare leg, pushing back the soft fabric of her black skirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell!&#x201d; MJ said, kicking out as her eyes sprang open, her foot making solid contact with an upper thigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooof.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clutching his leg in the chair next to hers sat Chris. He wore wrinkled khakis and a cream-colored Cuban shirt, pulled tight over his broad shoulders while hiding the small belly that had formed over once-taut muscles. They both had grown softer with the years&#x2014;on the outside, at least. His short, brown hair, spiked from a day of running his hands through it, combined with stubble to make him look younger&#x2014;if she overlooked the scattering of silver peppered among the darker scruff. His familiar blue eyes squinted at the sun, deepening the wrinkles at the corners.<br> <br>Her stomach used to flip when she looked at him. Perhaps the alcohol and pie were weighing it down, trapping the butterflies that once zigzagged with glee. She still loved him&#x2014;of course she did&#x2014;but the wings had stilled. Missing their anniversary would do that to delicate insects.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know better than to sneak up on me,&#x201d; MJ said, tamping down the mild satisfaction of kicking her husband, but he really should have known better than to surprise her like that. She brushed away the last few pie crumbs still on the table, keeping secret her failed attempt at a romantic surprise. Their knees bumped beneath the cozy table and she tucked her legs under the chair to give him more space so they wouldn&#x2019;t need to touch. When did I start doing that?<br> <br>Chris turned his head to look at her, setting a hand on her knee. MJ refrained from pulling back. That would start an entirely new discussion she didn&#x2019;t want to have right now. Best to just let his hand rest there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose I deserved that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry I&#x2019;m late. I didn&#x2019;t expect to get as deep in the tournament as I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>MJ wanted to get angry, to wave her arms and shout or fold them and pout, but she couldn&#x2019;t muster the ire for more than a shrug. She reached for her drink, pulling her leg out of her husband&#x2019;s reach, then looked at him levelly over her sunglasses.<br> <br>&#x201c;And your phone doesn&#x2019;t work?&#x201d; she began, but her words lacked the bite of accusation. Perhaps the brandy had burned off the edge, she reasoned.<br> <br>He tilted his head down as his lips curved, showing his perfect teeth&#x2014;a genuine smile, just for her&#x2014;then squeezed her knee. Chris had two smiles. His polite smile, the I-don&#x2019;t-want-to-be-here-but-have-to-act-like-I-do one, was for when a smile was expected but not earned, like at work events and extended-family gatherings. He would part his lips, crinkle his eyes, and keep them trained on whoever was speaking. But when he really meant it, when smiling was an uncontrollable instinct, he dipped his head and closed his eyes, almost as if he was trying to hide it&#x2014;a secret amusement just for himself. And when he laughed he threw his head back, unable to keep his mirth inside, no longer caring who noticed. She once lived for those head-tossing moments, proud that she could draw the laughter out of him. It was his laugh she&#x2019;d fallen in love with first, but that was a long time ago.<br> <br>She wished he had laughed just now but was relieved to have at least earned a genuine smile.<br> <br>A tiny butterfly flopped to life.<br> <br>&#x201c;I brought you something.&#x201d; His voice rose a bit at the end. He did that when he was hiding something. &#x201c;Hopefully it will ease that line on your forehead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Who didn&#x2019;t love a little bribery? MJ leaned forward while running a finger across her forehead, trying to smooth it out. Probably a lost cause.<br> <br>&#x201c;You did? What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>From his pocket, Chris pulled a clear plastic bubble. Inside jangled a ring with a bright yellow smiley face. He popped open the container and slid it onto her finger, adjusting the cheap metal to fit. MJ held out her hand, admiring the new bauble for her ever-growing collection&#x2014;though additions had been fewer in recent years. She&#x2019;d always loved the bright colors and whimsical designs of the gum-ball machine rings, starting with the one he had given her on the night he had proposed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lovely, as always,&#x201d; she said, the butterfly becoming more persistent.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m assuming you ate without me?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I waited, but when you didn&#x2019;t show, I ate a big lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really am sorry I missed our lunch date, Moon. Not much of an anniversary, is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>MJ&#x2019;s nerves began a low hum. He hadn&#x2019;t used that nickname in months, maybe even years. He&#x2019;d given it to her after learning her full name (and her strong preference that it never be used), Margaret June, during one of Barbara&#x2019;s making-sure-my-daughter-is-still-alive visits during college. It had become their private joke, a mash-up of the despised name into a beloved nickname.<br> <br>Chris twisted his torso while looking around the deck, taking in the view he&#x2019;d been missing. &#x201c;I got to the final table in the tournament, so I need to go back in an hour to finish. But I could win enough for a trip. Maybe something for the two of us?&#x201d; He turned to her.<br> <br>She knew what he was waiting for, what he wanted her to say. He wanted her concession that his poker playing wasn&#x2019;t ruining their anniversary. He wanted her permission to not feel guilty for abandoning her. Her heart thudded dully as she realized that she wasn&#x2019;t even mad or frustrated with him. She was . . . relieved? Tonight, maybe she&#x2019;d finish her book and binge-watch the DVR with the kids before taking a long bath. She might even start another novel. A perfect Saturday evening&#x2014;just, without her husband.<br> <br>MJ smiled and squeezed Chris&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go. Win big.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chris squinted his eyes, trying to find hers behind the sunglasses. He could always tell when she was lying by looking into her eyes. Thank God for Ray-Bans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sinceriously.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chris&#x2019;s lips twitched at her word choice, his shoulders sagging with relief as he let out the breath that had held in all his spousal guilt.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t deserve you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Obviously not.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stood, then bent so his face was close to hers. His whiskers tickled her face before his lips found hers in a functional kiss. For an instant, she remembered a time when she fantasized about nibbling on his bottom lip for hours. Now she focused on the wintergreen taste of his kiss and waited for him to pull away so she could return to her peaceful solitude. Chris straightened with one final rote smile. MJ took another sip of her old-fashioned, erasing the mint taste.<br> <br>His eyes moved from her to her drink; his lips opened to form words. Over her sunglasses, she raised her eyebrows and he closed his mouth immediately. After setting enough money on the table to cover her bill and a generous tip, MJ stood, swaying from the change in position. She wasn&#x2019;t just tipsy&#x2014;she was drunk. Dammit, I can&#x2019;t drive home like this. Chris watched as she stabilized, knowing better than to help her. She estimated how long it would take her to walk the three miles back to their house and the number of blisters she&#x2019;d get from doing so in her strappy wedge sandals. She took a sip from the previously untouched water and gritted her teeth against her lifelong hatred of having to ask for help.<br> <br>But she swallowed her pride enough to quietly request, &#x201c;Can you give me a ride home?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>The car eased up the driveway to their cozy saltbox house, tucked among tall oak trees still clinging to their summer green while the towering maples down the street were already starting to turn. Chris coasted the car into the garage, and as soon as the car stopped, their Muppet-like dog, Daisy, danced outside MJ&#x2019;s door, waiting to greet her with kisses and dirty paw prints, as if she&#x2019;d been away for days, not hours. MJ took a deep breath, trying to shake off the daytime-booze-induced fogginess. Chris turned his head to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to go back to the casino.&#x201d; He thought she was sighing about him. How could she explain without triggering a fight? She fumbled for a benign response when two teenagers opened the garage door and raced out in stocking feet. MJ smiled, as she always did when she saw her littles, even though they were little no more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, can we eat soon? Tommy ate all the food,&#x201d; said Kate. As usual, her long, dark hair hung in a wavy ponytail down her back. She wore her glasses, lending an air of studiousness to MJ&#x2019;s already-smart girl. Sometimes too smart. It was unnerving to lose arguments to your own child, and MJ had been losing them to Kate since she was eight. She had her father&#x2019;s height, MJ&#x2019;s earthy brown hair and eyes, and an attitude all her own. MJ never worried about boys getting the best of Kate. At seventeen, she loathed the teenage boys crawling the high school halls. MJ hoped that sense of superiority would last one more year until her girl was far away at college.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like you were even home, nerd. She&#x2019;s being lame, Mom. I didn&#x2019;t eat everything and I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d; Tommy shoved his sister. MJ didn&#x2019;t doubt he ate most of the food, even in the few hours she had been gone. She&#x2019;d heard about teenage boys and food, but the reality was more like the gaping maw of a black hole, sucking all edible matter into its void, never filling up. God help her when his friends came over, especially after baseball practice. Recently, Tommy was never without a baseball in one hand and food in the other. As tall as his sister, he had his father&#x2019;s brown, unruly curls, which he kept too long in Chris&#x2019;s opinion, but MJ liked the boyish mop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine, you left the edamame and brown bananas,&#x201d; Kate said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, guys. Can we at least get out of the car before we have to listen to that?&#x201d; Chris said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Way to go, dumbass.&#x201d; Kate shoved her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;I went grocery shopping this morning, but I didn&#x2019;t have time to put it all away.

In this lovely picture book, a father, his two sons, and one dog rise (very early) to the occasion and set off at dawn to the sugar bush to begin the process. Rossiter paints the action so that it is both personal and factual; we see the entire family involved - Mom preparing the meals, Dad steering the big John Deer tractor through the fields, and the two sons, Seth and Ethan, learning how to steer, collecting the buckets, and replacing them on the spouts, and, of course, the loyal hound Chloe (probably the only dog so named on any farm in New England) trotting along for the ride. Everyone participates in the hard work - hauling the buckets full of sap to the holding tank - and also in the fun work - reducing forty gallons of sap to one gallon of syrup in a big evaporator in the steamy storehouse. And, of course, testing and tasting the syrup. Continually.<br><p><br>Lovingly illustrated and infused with the lucid light of early Spring, the book is a real charmer: a testimony to the spirit and traditions of New England and a reminder of the very real values found only on family farms.</p></p><p>Nan Parson Rossiter is the author-illustrator of Rugby &amp; Rosie, a 1999 American Bookseller Pick of the Lists, and The Way Home, one of Smithsonian Magazine's Notable Books for Children in 1999. She lives in Connecticut with her husband and two sons. Every spring, the Rossiters look forward to visiting a maple-sugar farm in Vermont, where they indulge in plenty of sugar on snow.PreSchool-Grade 2-An overview of a special spring harvest in the Vermont woods. Seth and Ethan help their parents collect sap and make maple syrup. Seth is particularly excited about his chance to drive the small tractor that pulls the collecting tank to the sugar bush. From rising at dawn to eating fresh maple syrup drizzled on snow late in the evening, the boys pitch in with the tasks required to turn maple sap into a golden treat. The afterword summarizes a Native American legend about maple syrup and briefly describes current technology that simplifies sap collection. The illustrations of wildlife and the woods are clear and engaging. Each text block is accompanied by a close-up of a bird or animal, often enlarged from the scene on the facing page. However, the people have a static, somewhat idealized quality, as though posing for tableaux in an outdoor clothing catalog. Less nostalgic than Marsha Wilson Chall's Sugarbush Spring (Lothrop, 2000) and Jessie Haas's Sugaring (Greenwillow, 1996), Rossiter's book demonstrates how a family can contribute to a process that generates its own sweet rewards.<br><i>Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thursday Night Widows</h2><p><p>"An agile novel written in a language perfectly pitched for the subject matter, a ruthless dissection of a fast decaying society"&#x2014;<b>Jos� Saramago</b>, Nobel Prize winner</p><p><b>The English translation of hit novel <i>Las Viudas de Los Jueves</i>!</b></p><p>&#x201c;Pi�eiro&#x2019;s clever U.S. debut.. . illuminates the hypocrisies of the country's upper classes after 9/11.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Pi�eiro is particularly skilful at exposing the social forces undermining Argentine society, and the fragility of personal relationships.

Readers gradually become acquainted with the rich families of the Heights through Maria, who is privy to their secrets, selling them their homes while living in the community herself. But she is always a bit of an outsider, one of the few women who work, and when the bodies of three of the most prominent men in the community are found dead in a neighbor&#x2019;s backyard pool, she must decide where her loyalties lie, since her husband was visiting the three men shortly before their deaths. A fast-paced thriller, Pineiro&#x2019;s novel describes and critiques the lifestyles of Argentina&#x2019;s nouveau riche, chronicling their rise into the exclusive world of the Heights and their downfalls as the economy sours after 9/11.

Their antagonism, propelled by clashing personalities, contrasting views, and a deep, abiding animosity, would drive them to a bitterness so deep that even civil conversation was often impossible. Played out against the backdrop of the turbulent 1960s, theirs was a monumental political battle that would shape federal policy, fracture the Democratic party, and have a lasting effect on the politics of our times. Drawing on previously unexamined recordings and documents, as well as memoirs, biographies, and scores of personal interviews, Jeff Shesol weaves the threads of this epic story into a compelling narrative that reflects the impact of LBJ and RFK's tumultuous relationship on politics, civil rights, the war on poverty, and the war in Vietnam. As <em>Publishers Weekly</em> noted, "This is indispensable reading for both experts on the period and newcomers to the history of that decade." "An exhaustive and fascinating history. . . . Shesol's grasp of the era's history is sure, his tale often entertaining, and his research awesome."&#x2015;Russell Baker, <em>New York Review of Books</em> "Thorough, provocative. . . . The story assumes the dimensions of a great drama played out on a stage too vast to comprehend."&#x2015;Jonathan Yardley, <em>Washington Post</em> (1997 Critic's Choice) "This is the most gripping political book of recent years."&#x2015;Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of the Year Illustrations and photographs</p><p>Jeff Shesol is the author of Supreme Power:&nbsp;Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court and Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade. He was a speechwriter in the Clinton administration and lives in Washington, DC.An extensive, minutely detailed analysis of the Lyndon B. JohnsonRobert F. Kennedy mutual-fear-and-loathing society. Entire books have been written examining Lyndon Johnson's presidency in which Robert F. Kennedy is but a very minor player. In his book, Shesol filters Johnson's entire vice-presidential and presidential careers through the lens of his hatred of Robert Kennedy and RFK's reciprocal contempt for Johnson. In his first book, Shesol, a political cartoonist, sets out to prove that from 1959 to 1968 both Kennedy and Johnson made ``few important decisions without first considering'' their mutual contempt, which was ``the defining relationship of their political lives.'' Shesol offers a mountain of evidence to buttress these original claims. The book is filled to overflowing with detailed reconstructions of many of the political actions RFK and LBJ took. Shesol is correct- -to a very limited degree. The two men hated each other viciously, and their hatred had an impact on some of their political decisions. Those facts are well documented here and elsewhere. But Shesol does not come close to proving that the mutual hatred was a key factor in Johnson's presidency or in Kennedy's political career. Shesol claims, for example, that Johnson's Vietnam War policymaking, by mid-1967, was ``inextricably bound to the Johnson-Kennedy feud.'' The feud had some impact, but Shesol either ignores or cursorily mentions the many other, much more crucial factors. They include the intransigence of the Vietnamese communists, the weakness of our South Vietnamese ally, pressures from the American Joint Chiefs and from conservative Republicans, threats from China, and Johnson's strong desire to win the 1964 election and, later, enact his Great Society programs. A myopic portrait of two powerful politicians that all but ignores any actions other than their spiteful, petulant, petty personal feuding.

"Hitler's favorite commando" acquired a reputation as a man of daring, renowned for his audacious 1943 mission to extricate Mussolini from a mountain-top prison. Skorzeny's influence on special operations doctrine was far-reaching and long-lasting--in 2011, when US Navy SEALs infiltrated Pakistan to eliminate Osama Bin Laden, the operational planning was influenced by Skorzeny's legacy. Yet he was also an egoist who stole other men's credit (including for the seminal rescue of Mussolini), brave and resourceful but also an unrepentant Nazi, and a self-aggrandizing hogger of the limelight. </p><p> Stuart Smith draws on years of in-depth research to uncover the truth about Skorzeny's career and complex personality. From his background as a student radical in Vienna, to his bloody service with the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front, his surprise rebirth as a commando, and his intriguing post-war career and mysterious fortune, this book tells Otto Skorzeny's story in full--warts and all--for the first time.</p></p><p><p><b>Stuart Smith</b> is a business journalist.

The sharp-eyed and sympathetic witnesses to these events are Caroline Sanford, Hollywood actress turned Washington D.C., newspaper publisher, and Peter Sanford, her nephew and publisher of the independent intellectual journal <i>The American Idea.</i> They experience at first hand the masterful maneuvers of Franklin Roosevelt to bring a reluctant nation into the Second World War, and, later, the actions of Harry Truman that commit the nation to a decade-long twilight struggle against Communism&#x2014;developments they regard with a decided skepticism even though it ends in an American global empire. The locus of these events is Washington D.C., yet the Hollywood film industry and the cultural centers of New York also play significant parts. In addition to presidents, the actual characters who appear so vividly in the pages of <b>The Golden Age</b> include Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Wendell Willkie, William Randolph Hearst, Dean Acheson, Tennessee Williams, Joseph Alsop, Dawn Powell&#x2014;and Gore Vidal himself.<br><br><b>The Golden Age</b> offers up U.S. history as only Gore Vidal can, with unrivaled penetration, wit, and high drama, allied to a classical view of human fate. It is a supreme entertainment that is not only sure to be a major bestseller but that will also change listeners' understanding of American history and power.</p><p>Since 1967, when he published <i>Washington, D.C.</i>, Gore Vidal has been assembling an artful, acidic history of the United States. <i>The Golden Age</i> represents the seventh and final installment of this national epic, covering the years from 1939 to 1954 (with a valedictory fast-forward, in its final pages, to the end of the millennium). As Vidal did in the earlier books, the author sticks pretty rigorously to the facts. Real-life figures--in this case, the likes of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman and that ardent cold warrior Dean Acheson--do what they are recorded to have done. The author also ushers on a cast of invented characters, who are free to paddle in the historical backwash and comment upon their so-called contemporaries. It's here, of course, that fact and fiction begin to blur. But Vidal himself has often cited Tolstoy's famous jab--"History would be an excellent thing if it only were true"--and his reconstruction of FDR's wartime machinations, and the brief interval of Pax Americana, seem persuasively, even alarmingly plausible.<p> There's one key difference between this book and its predecessors, however. Vidal was alive and kicking in 1939, and thanks to his role as Senator Thomas Pryor Gore's grandson (and occasional seeing-eye dog), he met or at least observed many of <i>The Golden Age</i>'s dramatis personae. This fact turns out to have a double edge. On one hand, it gives his portraits of the high and mighty an extra ounce of verisimilitude. Here (the invented) Caroline Sanford observes her old friend FDR at an informal White House mixer: </p><blockquote> She felt for an instant that she should curtsey in the awesome presence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a figure who towered even when seated in his wheelchair. It was the head and neck that did the trick, she decided, with a professional actor's eye. The neck was especially thick while the famous head seemed half again larger than average, its thinning gray hair combed severely back from a high rounded forehead. </blockquote> Like all of Vidal's politicians, FDR is a more or less gifted illusionist, and <i>The Golden Age</i> is one more chapter in the convergence of theater and politics, of Hollywood and Washington, D.C. But the very vividness of these historical actors (in every sense of the phrase) makes the author's invented cast seem a little pale and lifeless. No matter. Even in its occasional longueurs, Vidal's concluding volume is packed with ironic insight and world-class gossip, much of it undoubtedly true. And in the surprisingly metafictional finale, he signs off with a fine display of Heraclitean fireworks, not to mention an encore appearance from his rakish progenitor Aaron Burr--which makes you wonder exactly who created whom. <i>--James Marcus</i>"[A] true magnum opus."<br>--<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>"A smart, witty Washington novel...

In <i>The Anti-Aesthetic</i>, preeminent critics such as Jean Baudrillard, Rosalind Krauss, Fredric Jameson, and Edward Said consider the full range of postmodern cultural production, from the writing of John Cage, to Cindy Sherman's film stills, to Barbara Kruger's collages. With a redesigned cover and a new afterword that situates the book in relation to contemporary criticism, <i>The Anti-Aesthetic</i> provides a strong introduction for newcomers and a point of reference for those already engaged in discussions of postmodern art, culture, and criticism.

For Friedrich Hayek, it was a mirage a meaningless, ideological, incoherent, vacuous clich�. He believed the term should be avoided, abandoned, and allowed to die a natural death. For its proponents, social justice is a catchall term that can be used to justify any progressive-sounding government program. It endures because it venerates its champions and brands its opponents as supporters of social injustice, and thus as enemies of humankind. As an ideological marker, social justice always works best when it is not too sharply defined.<br> <br>In <i>Social Justice Isn&#x2019;t What You Think It Is</i>, Michael Novak and Paul Adams seek to clarify the true meaning of social justice and to rescue it from its ideological captors. In examining figures ranging from Antonio Rosmini, Abraham Lincoln, and Hayek, to Popes Leo XIII, John Paul II, and Francis, the authors reveal that social justice is not a synonym for progressive&#x201d; government as we have come to believe. Rather, it is a virtue rooted in Catholic social teaching and developed as an alternative to the unchecked power of the state. Almost all social workers see themselves as progressives, not conservatives. Yet many of their best practices&#x201d; aim to empower families and local communities. They stress not individual or state, but the vast social space between them. Left and right surprisingly meet.<br> <br>In this surprising reintroduction of its original intention, social justice represents an immensely powerful virtue for nurturing personal responsibility and building the human communities that can counter the widespread surrender to an ever-growing state.<br></p><p>I have read this book with real delight. Clear, profound, inspiring, and brilliant. Rocco Buttiglione, Italian Chamber of Deputies<br> <br>Adams and Novak write with compelling clarity and force. They make a rich contribution to our understanding of social justice and the policy implications that flow from it. Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., Archbishop of Philadelphia<br> <br>A profound treatise on a topic dear to the heart of political progressives and social work professionals. Those who have never given the meaning of social justice a second thought will be greatly rewarded with reflective insights and a new understanding. Those who think they know the meaning of social justice will be challenged to think again and more deeply. Neil Gilbert, Chernin Professor of Social Welfare, University of California, Berkeley<br> <br>Elegantly, winsomely, and with telling examples, Adams and Novak show how Catholic Social Thought challenges conventional "liberal" and "conservative" approaches to social issues. &nbsp;This is a terrific book for anyone who is prepared to look anew at the dilemmas facing a society that aspires to be both free and compassionate. Mary Ann Glendon, Professor of Law, Harvard University<br> <br>A distinctively <i>caritas</i> and catholic take on the concept of social justice that is rich in its originality, provocative, thoughtful in exposition, challenging us to transform our approach to social policy. John Braithwaite, Distinguished Professor, Australian National University<br> <br>This book presents an innovative vision of social justice as a preeminent, creative, and outgoing virtue deeply rooted in genuine Catholic social thought. It provides an indispensable guide for advancing the common good in a contemporary landscape plagued by a pervasive secularism and an extreme moral relativism. William C. Brennan, Professor, School of Social Work, Saint Louis University<br> <br>The challenge of writing about CST is that doing so expertly requires prodigious learning in not only the Catholic tradition, but also in so many contiguous fields such as economics, politics, law, theology, philosophy. Thankfully, our authors are masters of their craft. And they have produced a marvelous restatement, and interpretation, of this important body of Church teaching. Gerard V. Bradley, Professor of Law, University of Notre Dame<br> <br>Before reading this book, I was suspicious of the phrase social justice.&nbsp;In Latin America, politicians and policy makers who use the social justice banner have committed many injustices. Acting supposedly on behalf of the general interest, the common good or the poor, government programs essentially concentrate power, bloat bureaucracies and often promote corruption. Adams and Novak surprised me when they distilled, from Catholic social thought and other sources, a definition centered on free individuals, as opposed to the Leviathan state. The Novak seal is evident because the definition emphasizes innovation, creativity and human flourishing. Here, social justice, like plain justice, is a virtue that empowers individual persons to act for themselves, to exercise their inborn social creativity.&#x201d;&nbsp;How much will societies improve when they embrace this paradigm of social justice instead of the statist conception? Carroll Rios de Rodriguez, Professor of Economics, Francisco Marroqu�n University, Guatemala<br> <br> <i>Social Justice Isn't What You Think It Is</i> by Paul Adams and Michael Novak is a thoughtfully iconoclastic analysis and exposition of social justice as a virtue through the lens of Catholic social teaching rejecting both individualism and collectivism and emphasizing the role of mediating social structures. Paul Adams, in particular, explores the application of social justice for Christians in professional social work. This book is an important resource for everyone interested in social justice and Christian practice. David A. Sherwood, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Social Work &amp; Christianity</i> <br> <br>No concept in ethical and political philosophy is more in need of clarification and critical analysis than that of social justice.&#x201d; This term is a relatively late arrival in Catholic vocabulary. Adams and Novak provide a careful, thorough analysis of the term and the ideas and approach that make it useful. They also explain the ease with which the term can be misused. This is a very welcome book, not to be missed by anyone at all concerned with public order and understanding. James V. Schall, S.J., Professor Emeritus, Georgetown University<br> <br>Michael Novak and Paul Adams' new book places the important discussion of social justice squarely within the best scholarship of the Catholic intellectual tradition. By transcending ideological biases, reading and interpreting the pertinent encyclicals impartially, and avoiding all political agendas, this thought-provoking new book should be welcomed by both the left and the right because of its fair, balanced, and reasoned approach. John G. Trapani, Jr., Professor of Philosophy, Walsh University<br> <br>The difficult and risky underground publication of Novak&#x2019;s <i>The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism</i> in 1985 was widely circulated among the Polish democratic opposition and inspired many debates about how to shape the free Poland for which we fought. This new book will remind Poles of the breathtaking appearance of <i>SDC</i> 30 years ago. When small groups discussed with John Paul II Novak&#x2019;s ideas, including those on social justice and others in the present volume, the pope several times said he considered Novak one of his best lay friends in the West. On those occasions when Novak was present, the pope listened with great attention. -- Rev. Maciej Zieba, OP, author of <i>Papal Economics: The Catholic Church on Democratic Capitalism, from</i> Rerum Novarum <i>to</i> Caritas in Veritate<br> <br>Adams and Novak take on the hard task of defining social justice, which they identify as a personal virtue of a special modern type. Novak is unusually aware of abuses of the term by statists in former socialist lands like Slovakia, the country of his ancestors. Adams is especially good on the connection between charity and justice, and on the relation of marriage to both. &nbsp;Here in Europe, this book does a great and original service. Juraj Kohutiar, emeritus Director of International Affairs, Slovak Christian-Democratic Party, former anticommunist dissident and Underground Church&#x201d; activist<br> <br>I lived half of my life in Argentina, where the overwhelming majority adopted as a guiding policy principle a statist concept of social justice. I lived my other half in the United States, where many have practiced social justice as explained by Adams and Novak, building the institutions of a free and charitable society. Argentina was destroyed, the United States still has a chance. This immensely valuable book provides rich foundations for those who love liberty, justice, and a social environment conducive to human flourishing.

For while he and his brother struggle to save two drowning swimmers, a tragedy is unfolding down the road at his summer cottage. Instead of coming home to a hero�s welcome, Pietro is greeted by the flashing lights of an ambulance, the wide-eyed stare of his young daughter, Claudia, and the terrible news that his fianc�e, Lara, is dead. </p> <p> Life must go on. Or does it? Pietro, a true iconoclast, has to find his own way. When he drops Claudia off for the first day of school, he decides to wait outside for her all day, and then every day. To protect her. To protect himself. To wait for the heavy fist of grief to strike. But as the days and weeks go by, the small parking lot in front of the school becomes his refuge from the world as well as the place where family and colleagues come to relieve their own suffering�among them, the woman he rescued from the waves. And Pietro plunges deeper into the depths of his life before seeing the simple truth before his eyes. </p> Sandro Veronesi makes art of every detail, creating a mosaic of humor, hope, profound insight, and emotional resonance. <i>Quiet Chaos</i> is an unprecedented portrayal of a life set adrift by death.<p></p></p><p><p>Sandro Veronesi was born in Prato, Italy, in 1959. <em>The Force of the Past</em>, is his first to be published in America. He lives in Rome, Italy.</p>In Veronesi's absorbing second novel translated into English (after The Force of the Past), Italian television executive Pietro Paladini saves a woman from drowning at the exact moment his wife, Lara, suddenly dies. After the unexpected death, Pietro becomes enveloped in a strange calm, and he spends each day outside his daughter's school, observing the quiet rhythms of life. Meanwhile, his bosses visit him to share cryptic information about a messy corporate merger, and his co-workers, buckling under the strain of the merger, turn to him for advice and go a little crazy. Things get even messier when Pietro encounters the woman he rescued, Eleonora, a wealthy seductress whose life has also been upended by that pivotal moment. Veronesi finds some success in this courageous and difficult project, creating an unreliable narrator who feels an unusual manifestation of grief, though the subplots are so crudely satirical that it's unclear where the winking satire ends and the realist psychological drama begins. Moore's translation is commendable, especially considering the cacophony of voices and Pietro's racing, fractured narration as he dwells in that space between sorrow and madness.

He depicts the life of Christ and his teachings and explains how the apostles set out to spread the Gospel. With a special emphasis on global Christianity, Marty shows how the religion emerged from its ancestral homeland in Africa, the Levant, and Asia Minor, was imported to Europe, and then expanded from there to the rest of the world. While giving a broad overview, Marty also focuses on specific issues, such as how Christianity attempts to reconcile with the teachings of Christ some of its stances on armed conflict, justice, and dominion. <i>The Christian World</i> is a remarkable testament to how Christ&#x2019;s message has touched human experience everywhere.</p><p>Martin Marty has written a number of seminal works on religion, and has received some seventy-five honorary doctorates. His awards include the National Book Award, the National Humanities Medal, and the Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He lives in Chicago with his wife.1.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jewish<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginnings<br> &nbsp;<br> Yeshuanity&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jesusanity&#x201d; would be a natural name for a global community and culture devoted to Yeshua, or Jesus of Nazareth, depending on whether the namers favored his Hebrew or his Latinized name. &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; is instead the designation, and its communal form is not the Jesus Church but the Christian Church. Nor is Christ the last name of this Jesus, but a translation of the Hebrew or Aramaic word messias, which means &#x201c;anointed,&#x201d; and refers to someone appointed to a specific role. To neglect or to obscure the meaning of the title Christ when applied to Jesus, the rabbi from Nazareth, is to miss the point of the earliest writings about him and to skew the story line ever after.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another World to Live in, and Its Stories<br> &nbsp;<br> The Christian World is an invitation for readers to enter and appraise a global scene, &#x201c;the world,&#x201d; through twenty centuries. At the same time the Christian &#x201c;world&#x201d; also means all the contexts to which Christian believers related and relate. &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; may imply institutions and can be expressed through doctrines and ways of life, but at its core it is a story. Philosopher George Santayana connected &#x201c;world&#x201d; and &#x201c;story&#x201d; precisely, as will we. In Reason in Religion he remarked that &#x201c;every living and healthy religion has a marked idiosyncrasy.&#x201d; Ask atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, or others to listen to Christians and they will soon discern the main &#x201c;marked idiosyncrasy&#x201d;: the devotion to Jesus Christ.<br> &nbsp;<br> As these listeners observe the effects of what they have heard they will note what Santayana told readers to look for, in this case it would mean that Christianity&#x2019;s &#x201c;power consists in its special and surprising message,&#x201d; rooted in the story of Jesus Christ, &#x201c;and in the bias which that revelation gives to life.&#x201d; Billions of people have let that revelation &#x201c;bias&#x201d; them, so that they could experience joy and peace or, conversely and often at the same time, face persecution, hardship, or even death in its light. Santayana spoke of &#x201c;the vistas&#x201d; a religion like Christianity opens, &#x201c;and the mysteries it propounds,&#x201d; and these will be obvious to all who follow the story. Now: taken together they make up &#x201c;another world to live in, and another world to live in&#x2014;whether we expect ever to pass wholly over into it or no&#x2014;is what we mean by having a religion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginning with the Story of Jesus Christ<br> &nbsp;<br> The &#x201c;special and surprising message&#x201d; of Christianity begins with Jesus Christ, so if we wish to go back to beginnings, we begin with his story. The earliest Christians were, like Jesus, Jews. This means that they were schooled in Hebrew Scriptures, which Christians later called &#x201c;the Old Testament.&#x201d; They reread those Scriptures and gave them a &#x201c;special and surprising&#x201d; twist. Believers took words of the prophets and claimed that they foretold Jesus, or they told stories of scriptural figures like Moses and Elijah, Noah and Jonah, and saw them as &#x201c;types&#x201d; of Jesus Christ and his story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesus was a Jew: that theme needs reinforcing, especially because so much of Christian history is a wrestling with the meanings of Jews and Judaism. The two faiths should have been supportive of each other, as spiritual next of kin. Anthropologists stress what is obvious about kin: &#x201c;aggression, like charity, begins at home.&#x201d; As the upstart believers in Jesus Christ as the long-promised deliverer of Israel, the Messiah, the Christ, expressed that startling claim, some Jews who did not see him that way and who thought his claims blasphemous ejected the believers in Jesus Christ from their synagogues and persecuted them. For twenty centuries the once ejected Christians exacted revenge or, on any number of grounds, set out on their own to be separate, to define themselves over against those in their parent faith community, as they turned murderous in patterns for which there was little formal and corporate repentance until the late twentieth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> Getting the story of Jesus right is difficult, and no single interpretation can be satisfying to all 2.2 billion Christians, since they are divided into 38,000 denominations, many of them fashioned to protect and project separate tellings of the story. Yet certain elements of the story stand out. To begin with, the narratives about Jesus Christ were all written by followers, called disciples or evangelists, which means spreaders of the evangel, the &#x201c;good news.&#x201d; In these stories, he chose twelve followers to stand out, no doubt to mirror the twelve tribes of Israel. Four books in the Christian New Testament called gospels were named after three authors or editors who pursued parallel tracks, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, while a fourth, identified with John, displays different nuances and intentions. Not exactly biographies or histories, the gospels are narrative testimonies to what the early communities cherished and wanted preserved. Luke tells how he went about his work interviewing eyewitnesses, reading documentary collections, and giving them coherence in his own edited narrative. These gospels stress different aspects of the life and work of Jesus. Luke, for instance, was especially attentive to the marginalized, among them women and children. His Jesus was always at table with outcasts, and he showed special favor to lepers and the physically handicapped&#x2014;and thus despised&#x2014;people around him.<br> &nbsp;<br> In recent times some of the texts which had not been incorporated into what became the shared collection or canon have been discovered as far from Jerusalem as Egypt, where some communities which identified themselves with Jesus long struggled. Other such writings, long known but neglected, receive new attention. To overstate the case slightly, most of these gospels display difficulty with either the human Jesus the Jew or Jesus the exalted being they called Lord. Some pose the whole questions of God and Jesus in arcane, hard to interpret terms. No matter what the claims any of these made and whatever appeal they have now to scholars and seekers especially in the affluent West, for most Christians around the globe it is the four gospel accounts that have provided the focus for their faith, the enchantment of their stories, and the impulse for their ministries and service.<br> &nbsp;<br> From these gospels the later believing communities have learned how Christians, originally all of them Jews, related to Judaism itself. In the period in which the gospels were being written, the Romans put down a revolt by oppressed Jews. They besieged the city and destroyed the Second Temple, the center of Jewish worship. Most scholars see these traumatic events as elements in the shaping of the gospels. They are reflected in words of Jesus about persecution, death, destruction, and the foreseen end-time. Mainly, however, the gospels have been revered because they provided the story of Jesus&#x2019; birth, the account of what is called his Passion or suffering and dying, and most of all his Resurrection. Framed by those events is the story of his life<br> &nbsp;<br> Since Christians make so much of the figure of Jesus, it is impressive and, to many, confounding, that there is so much that they can never know. Archaeology may turn up artifacts that can be studied to color the understandings of the time, but &#x201c;the historical Jesus,&#x201d; as some scholars call him while pursuing his trail, will always remain a subject of controversy and confusion, always finally elusive. If he was &#x201c;the exalted Lord,&#x201d; did he claim to be the Son of God or even, clearly, the Anointed of God, the Messiah? Why did the gospels report that he on occasion called himself the Son of Man, a figure vivid in the imagination of some apocalyptic Jews who thrived before his time? How did he become such a cherished figure among those who value the family, while his own family had trouble believing in him and while he so often dismissed and rejected family ties for the sake of the &#x201c;Kingdom of God&#x201d; that he was announcing? What did he do from age twelve to approximately age thirty, years about which the gospels are silent and pseudo-gospels tell fanciful tales?</p><h2>The Economization of Life</h2><p>What is a life worth? In the wake of eugenics, new quantitative racist practices that valued life for the sake of economic futures flourished. In <i>The Economization of Life</i>, Michelle Murphy provocatively describes the twentieth-century rise of infrastructures of calculation and experiment aimed at governing population for the sake of national economy, pinpointing the spread of a potent biopolitical logic: some must not be born so that others might live more prosperously. Resituating the history of postcolonial neoliberal technique in expert circuits between the United States&nbsp;and Bangladesh, Murphy traces the methods and imaginaries through which family planning calculated lives not worth living, lives not worth saving, and lives not worth being born. The resulting archive of thick data transmuted into financialized &#x201c;Invest in a Girl&#x201d; campaigns that reframed survival as a question of human capital. The book challenges readers to reject the economy as our collective container and to refuse population as a term of reproductive justice.</p><p>Michelle Murphy is Professor of History and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Toronto and the author of <i>Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Heath, and Technoscience</i> and <i>Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers</i>, both also published by Duke University Press."Though this book be concise, it is fierce.

Welcome to Lidia Yuknavitch&#x2019;s world. In Dora: A Headcase, Yuknavitch reimagines the girl, the woman, at the heart of Sigmund Freud&#x2019;s breakthrough case study and unleashes this character's fury against a backdrop of hypocritical adulthood. Yuknavitch is talking back to a hundred years, to the founding of psychoanalysis. I&#x2019;d like to think she wrote parts of this novel just for me, but so many readers will feel that way. Yuknavitch has wrestled with the force of her own convictions and given a powerful voice to a badass character born on the literary landscape. MONICA DRAKE author of Clown Girl<br><br>Dora is too much for Sigmund Freud but she&#x2019;s just right for us raunchy, sharp and so funny it hurts. KATHERINE DUNN author of Geek Love<br><br>In these times there's no reason for a novel to exist unless it's dangerous, provocative and not like anything that's come before. Dora: A Headcase is that kind of novel. It's dirty, sexy, rude, smart, soulful, fresh and risky. Think of your favorite out-there genius writer; multiply by ten, add a big heart, a poet's ear, and a bad girl's courage, and you've got Lidia Yuknavitch. KAREN KARBO, author of How Georgia Became O'Keeffe<br><br>Dora: A Head Case is first and foremost an irreverent portrait of a smart seventeen year old trying to survive. It channels Sigmund Freud and his young patient Dora and is both a hilarious critique and an oddly touching homage. With an unerring ear and a very keen eye, Lidia Yuknavitch casts a very special slant of light on our centuries and our lives. Put simply, the book is needed. CAROLE MASO author of Defiance and The Art Lover<br><br>Snappy and fun. I can pretty much guarantee you haven't met a character quite l like Ida before. BLAKE NELSON author of Girl and Paranoid Park<br><br>In Dora, [Lidia Yuknavitch] takes the most classic model of Thera-tainment, personal-crisis-as-content, and she re-imagines it wonderfully reversed. The world of Dora is not just possible, it&#x2019;s inevitable. It&#x2019;s revenge as the ultimate therapy. From the introduction by CHUCK PALAHNIUK author of Damned<br><br>When about to plummet to our deaths or fly we speak in a language all our own. Dora: A Headcase is a feminist retelling of Freud&#x2019;s famous case study, Dora. But the novel constantly transcends this conceit in beautiful and surprising ways. Sure there&#x2019;s literary discourse and feminist asides, feats of craft and vision, but in the end Yuknavitch drives narrative the way rednecks drive muscle cars. Right across your lawn without respect to boundaries. If Ida is a little scary to some readers, it&#x2019;s only because we&#x2019;ve forgotten that nothing is scarier than a teenage girl. They whisper things we don&#x2019;t want to hear that sometimes cutting is an act of freedom, like meditating without sleep, or starving yourself for the parallel bars. Also, that it&#x2019;s damn hard to do the right thing when you&#x2019;re in a dangerous conversation with the universe, one meant for god&#x2019;s ears alone.<br><br>Personally as someone whose teen years were hellish, I was floored by the softness and raw sorrow in Ida&#x2019;s voice, which Yuknavitch braided in with the anger. It felt more real, more like the girls I knew and was, than any other coming of age narrator. Put simply, Yuknavitch has written the best portrait of teen girlhood I have ever read. I loved this book it&#x2019;s like a smart, fast chick Fight Club. In twenty years, I hope to wake up in a world where Dora: A Headcase has replaced Catcher in the Rye on high school reading lists for the alienated. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that world would be a better one.

Rautzhan)</p><h2>Great German Poems of the Romantic Era: A Dual-Language Book (Dover Dual Language German)</h2><p><p>Lyric poetry blossomed in 19th-century Germany under the fertilizing influence of Romanticism with its focus on the primacy of the imagination, worship of nature and childhood, dreaminess and nostalgia and preoccupation with thoughts of night and death. Although strictly defined as flourishing from 1798 to 1835, Romanticism is not timebound and German Romantic poetry was written both before and after these dates. Indeed, the 131 poems in this volume range in date from 1770 to 1903.<br>Collected here are great romantic poems by 23 poets: Goethe, Schiller, Hiilderlin, Novalis, Tieck, Brentano, Ruckert, Heine, Miirike, Storm, Nietzsche, and 12 more. Stanley Appelbaum has provided excellent new literal English translations of the poems on facing pages, along with an informative introduction and concise evaluations of each poet. This is a wonderful opportunity for any student of German or lover of poetry to enjoy a rich sampling from one of the world&#x2019;s great poetic traditions.</p><p></p></p><p>Stanley Appelbaum served for decades as Dover&#39;s Editor in Chief until his retirement in 1996. He continues to work as a selector, compiler, editor, and translator of literature in a remarkable range of languages that includes Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Russian.Text: English, German (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Coming of Age in the Other America</h2><p><p> </p><p>Recent research on inequality and poverty has shown that those born into low-income families, especially African Americans, still have difficulty entering the middle class, in part because of the disadvantages they experience living in more dangerous neighborhoods, going to inferior public schools, and persistent racial inequality. <i>Coming of Age in the Other America</i> shows that despite overwhelming odds, some disadvantaged urban youth do achieve upward mobility. Drawing from ten years of fieldwork with parents and children who resided in Baltimore public housing, sociologists Stefanie DeLuca, Susan Clampet-Lundquist, and Kathryn Edin highlight the remarkable resiliency of some of the youth who hailed from the nation&#x2019;s poorest neighborhoods and show how the right public policies might help break the cycle of disadvantage.</p> <p><i>Coming of Age in the Other America</i> illuminates the profound effects of neighborhoods on impoverished families. The authors conducted in-depth interviews and fieldwork with 150 young adults, and found that those who had been able to move to better neighborhoods&#x2014;either as part of the Moving to Opportunity program or by other means&#x2014;achieved much higher rates of high school completion and college enrollment than their parents. About half the youth surveyed reported being motivated by an &#x201c;identity project&#x201d;&#x2014;or a strong passion such as music, art, or a dream job&#x2014;to finish school and build a career.</p> <p>Yet the authors also found troubling evidence that some of the most promising young adults often fell short of their goals and remained mired in poverty. Factors such as neighborhood violence and family trauma put these youth on expedited paths to adulthood, forcing them to shorten or end their schooling and find jobs much earlier than their middle-class counterparts. Weak labor markets and subpar postsecondary educational institutions, including exploitative for-profit trade schools and under-funded community colleges, saddle some young adults with debt and trap them in low-wage jobs. A third of the youth surveyed&#x2014;particularly those who had not developed identity projects&#x2014;were neither employed nor in school. To address these barriers to success, the authors recommend initiatives that help transform poor neighborhoods and provide institutional support for the identity projects that motivate youth to stay in school. They propose increased regulation of for-profit schools and increased college resources for low-income high school students.</p> <p><i>Coming of Age in the Other America</i> presents a sensitive, nuanced account of how a generation of ambitious but underprivileged young Baltimoreans has struggled to succeed. It both challenges long-held myths about inner-city youth and shows how the process of &#x201c;social reproduction&#x201d;&#x2014;where children end up stuck in the same place as their parents&#x2014;is far from inevitable.</p> <p></p></p><p>STEFANIE DELUCA is associate professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University.

PUTNAM</b>, Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy, Harvard University</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Stefanie DeLuca, Susan Clampet-Lundquist, and Kathryn Edin have written a deeply empathetic and insightful book providing a nuanced portrait of the tremendous resilience and untapped potential of low-income minority youth attempting to pursue the American Dream in the face of profound neighborhood and educational disadvantages in the other America. Their analysis suggests large gains from housing mobility and community development policies to improve the neighborhood environments experienced by disadvantaged children and youth.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;LAWRENCE F. KATZ</b>, Elisabeth Allison Professor of Economics, Harvard University</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Coming of Age in the Other America</i> tells the complex story of becoming an adult today in cities like Baltimore, where opportunities for youth are extremely limited. In contrast to stereotypes about minority inner-city adolescents, many of these resilient youth escaped the pull of the streets and achieved far more than their own parents. Yet, given the myriad of barriers that they face, too many others fall short of their potential. The account is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Anyone who wishes to understand how and why the path to adulthood is constrained for youth in our cities today must read this remarkable book. <i>Coming of Age in the Other America</i> is riveting, distressing, and uplifting all at once.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;JEANNE BROOKS-GUNN</b>, Virginia and Leonard Marx Professor of Child Development, Teachers College and College of Physicians and Surgeons</p></p><h2>Thunder in the Argonne: A New History of America&#39;s Greatest Battle (Battles and Campaigns Series)</h2><p>In July 1918, sensing that the German Army had lost crucial momentum, Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch saw an opportunity to end the First World War. In drafting his plans for a final grand offensive, he assigned the most difficult sector&#x2015;the dense Argonne forest and the vast Meuse River valley&#x2015;to the American Expeditionary Forces under General John J. Pershing. There, the Doughboys faced thickly defended German lines with terrain deemed impossible to fight through. From September 26 through the November 11 armistice, US forces suffered more than 20,000 casualties a week, but the Allies ultimately prevailed in a decisive victory that helped to end the Great War. <br><br>In <i>Thunder in the Argonne</i>, Douglas V. Mastriano offers the most comprehensive account of this legendary campaign to date. Not only does he provide American, French, and British perspectives on the offensive, but he also offers&#x2015;for the first time in English&#x2015;the German view. Mastriano presents a balanced analysis of successes and failures at all levels of command, examining the leadership of the principals while also illuminating acts of heroism by individual soldiers. <br><br>The Meuse-Argonne Offensive is widely regarded as one of America's finest hours, and the amazing feats of Sergeant Alvin York, Major Charles Whittlesey of the Lost Battalion, and Lieutenant Sam Woodfill&#x2015;all accomplished in the midst of this maelstrom&#x2015;echo across the ages. Published to coincide with the centennial of the campaign, this engaging book offers a fresh look at the battle that forged the modern US Army</p><p><b>Douglas V.

A colonel in the US Army and combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, he is the author of <i>Alvin York: A New Biography of the Hero of the Argonne.</i>"The modern US Army was born in the bloody 1918 battle of the Meuse-Argonne. As Colonel Douglas V. Mastriano recounts the story, this painful and traumatic beginning shaped the character of the American Army and endures one hundred years later. Read this book!"&#x2015;Major General David T. Zabecki, USA (Ret.)<p>"Mastriano expertly weaves into his narrative the stories of individuals who made a difference. Of course, there were thousands of instances of valor, witnessed and otherwise, and it's impossible to capture them all. But Mastriano has done a good job of selecting a representation of the grit and determination of the Americans who fought in the offensive. This book is recommended to those who want to read a fine account of this offensive and to those who would like to learn about the German side of the fighting."&#x2015;<i>Roads to the Great War</i></p><p>"Mastriano enriches his narrative with an assortment of personal stories, highlighting "feats of heroism and sacrifice on both sides" during "desperate and intense" fighting. He also supplements his text with an impressive collection of photographs depicting soldiers, rather than generals, trenches, and technology. His command of the sources enriches the book throughout."&#x2015;<i>Michigan War Studies Review</i></p><p>"This work takes a fresh look at the AEF's Meuse-Argonne offensive. Mastriano succinctly covers the early years of the war through America's entry, and on to the defeat of the German <i>Kaiserschlacht. </i>He then gives us an excellent analysis of the final Allied strategy to win the war with a series of coordinated blows. <i>Thunder in the Argonne </i>is an excellent read for anyone interested in World War I, the AEF, or the American soldier under fire."&#x2015;<i>NYMAS Review</i></p></p><h2>The Right Side: A Novel</h2><p>In this "brilliant...deeply felt" (Stephen King) novel by the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Chet and Bernie mystery series, a deeply damaged female soldier home from the war in Afghanistan becomes obsessed with finding a missing girl, gains an unlikely ally in a stray dog, and encounters new perils beyond the combat zone.<br><br>LeAnne Hogan went to Afghanistan as a rising star in the military, and came back a much lesser person, mentally and physically. Now missing an eye and with half her face badly scarred, she can barely remember the disastrous desert operation that almost killed her.

Her native land is now unfamiliar, recast in shadow by her one good eye, her damaged psyche, her weakened body. Arriving in the rain-soaked small town in Washington State that Marci called home, she makes a troubling discovery: Marci&#x2019;s eight-year-old daughter has vanished. When a stray dog&#x2014;a powerful, dark, unreadable creature, no one&#x2019;s idea of a pet&#x2014;seems to adopt LeAnne, a surprising connection is formed and something shifts inside her. As she becomes obsessed with finding Marci&#x2019;s daughter, LeAnne and her inscrutable canine companion are drawn into danger as dark and menacing as her last Afghan mission.

The chair made a squeaky sound, intolerable to the woman sitting on the other side of the desk.

She knew better.<br> <br>Machado&#x2014;Dr. Ernest Machado, Psychiatric Services, according to the name tag&#x2014;squinted at the screen. &#x201c;Still getting used to these darn progressives,&#x201d; he said, tapping his glasses.<br> <br>&#x201c;Poor you,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Dr. Machado shot her a speedy glance, returned to the screen, nudged his glasses a little higher up on his nose.<br> <br>That glance?

You should see some of the names we get here.&#x201d; Dr. Machado tapped at the keyboard, then squeaked back around to face her. She thought of killing him with her bare hands, but it was only one of so many thoughts in her head at that moment, scarcely noticeable.<br> <br>He gazed at her in the new off-center way people used on her now. &#x201c;How about we begin by you telling me why you&#x2019;re here?

Then she and her daddy walked up a long slope where some big saguaros grew, Daddy carrying the cooler. There were bullet holes in a few of those saguaros, always at the tops where the heads would be, if saguaros had heads, but she and Daddy were blameless.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell is wrong with some people?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it hurt the saguaros?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do think?

I only know from old photos.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I see them?&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy shook his head. &#x201c;All gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the fire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy tossed the empty into the cooler, helped himself to another cold one, and handed her one of those gingerbread men with mint-green eyes that Mom baked and LeAnne loved. The fire was a big deal in family history, burning down the house Daddy had grown up in, outside of Flagstaff, and killing his parents, meaning LeAnne&#x2019;s grandparents. Daddy was overseas at the time, just getting started in the service, and hadn&#x2019;t even met Mom yet, meaning this was way before LeAnne was born, so she&#x2019;d never known that set of grandparents. For different reasons, she didn&#x2019;t know the other set, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Daddy said, taking a nice sip. &#x201c;Enough chitchat. Let&#x2019;s see what you can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just sitting like this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Daddy gestured down at the 1947 Buick Roadmaster. &#x201c;Right side taillight still intact?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s intact?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unbroken.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne peered down. She had very sharp eyesight, according to Dr. Ralpundi, who did the preseason examinations for all the sports teams&#x2014;20/15 in her left eye, even better in her right. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Break it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The right, of course, was her shooting eye, although she kept the left open, Daddy-style. &#x201c;How else are you gonna know when someone comes after you outta left field?&#x201d; Which never failed to get her laughing, like suddenly baseball was turning up in your life.<br> <br>LeAnne raised Little P. &#x201c;Let the weapon find the target,&#x201d; Daddy always said. Also pretty funny, to LeAnne&#x2019;s way of thinking. Because how could it do that on its own? The weapon was just a thing. But she&#x2019;d learned early on that it turned out to be kind of true. She peered through the sight with her right eye, not looking at the distant taillight at all, just at the space inside the little V, let out every puff of her breath, stopped time, and in the moment before time would start up again, she pulled the trigger, pulling not being the right word. Pulling was too strong. This was more like the force you&#x2019;d use to press the thingamajig at the top of a ballpoint pen to make the tip stick out.<br> <br>Crack. But not a loud crack. This was only a .22, after all. Neither was there much in the way of recoil, just the slightest of kicks, like a baby in the mommy&#x2019;s tummy. Then came the soundless shattering of the taillight, and tiny red shards went flying in the sunshine. Real tiny, like solid blood drops. Weapon finds target.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Daddy said.<br> <br>Then it got very quiet, middle-of-the-desert quiet mixed in with that quiet that comes when the shooting stops. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s the same one,&#x201d; LeAnne said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great uncle Rodney&#x2019;s nineteen-forty-seven Buick Roadmaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get a notion like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not mad. Why&#x2019;d I be mad? I&#x2019;m just saying where&#x2019;d you get the goddamn notion?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It popped up in my mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked down at her again. Then he rumpled her hair. &#x201c;Got a head of hair on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom says there&#x2019;s nothing to be done with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She does, does she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A rat&#x2019;s nest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That what she calls it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy turned away, drained the cold one, tossed it in the cooler, and was reaching for another when he paused. &#x201c;Gimme that thing,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>LeAnne clicked the safety into place, handed him the .22.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe that is Rodney&#x2019;s old Roadmaster, after all,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Really, Daddy?&#x201d; She came close to jumping up and down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better odds than the lottery. Lottery&#x2019;s like millions to one. But the Roadmaster? Think about it. How many forty-seven&#x2019;s got sold in Arizona? A few thousand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So the odds would be a few thousand to one? Is that how you figure out odds?&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead, he stepped close to the edge of the ridge and yelled, &#x201c;Hey, Rodney! Heads up!&#x201d; And then, holding the .22 kind of casually, like Little P was only a toy, he took a series of shots, so quick it was almost like automatic fire, and a line of holes appeared all along the side of the Roadmaster, so perfectly and evenly spaced that they might have been part of the design.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; Dr. Machado said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; said LeAnne. She hadn&#x2019;t seen his approach&#x2014;he&#x2019;d come out of left field; actually, right. She took the coffee, didn&#x2019;t say thanks&#x2014;seemed like too much effort, plus who was this asshole anyway? And why was she here? She took a sip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enough sugar?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>What was that supposed to mean? She foresaw a hot and splashy ending to this interview. If that was what it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Play any baseball?&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You. Baseball. Did you play?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Why do you ask?&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne shrugged. Then came silence&#x2014;not that anyplace in the hospital was ever silent, or even close&#x2014;while Dr. Machado sat back down on the other side of the desk. He looked at her. She looked at a framed photo on the wall behind him: Dr. Machado, smiling in a polo shirt, with wife and two little boys, all smiling, all in polo shirts. She considered asking him if he&#x2019;d played any polo.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about we begin at the beginning?&#x201d; Dr. Machado said.<br> <br>She turned to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;With your early life&#x2014;father and mother, where you grew up, et cetera.&#x201d;<br> <br>She kept herself from saying, Let&#x2019;s begin with et cetera but offered nothing in its stead.<br> <br>Dr. Machado riffled though some papers. His fingernails were in great shape, salon quality. She didn&#x2019;t want to think about hers, so she didn&#x2019;t. Kept her mind far distant from her fingernails, especially the two that were still growing back in.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see here that your father was also military. Master Sergeant Rex Hogan, Green Berets.&#x201d; Dr. Machado looked up. &#x201c;Tell me about him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much to tell,&#x201d; LeAnne said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Checking the dates here, he seems to have left the army when you were . . . what? Eight or nine? What sort of work did he do after that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t it say?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Machado nodded. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s always nice to confirm the written data.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne had no interest in that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you describe your relationship with him?&#x201d; Dr. Machado went on. &#x201c;Or would you prefer to start somewhere else, with your mother, for example?&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne rose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer to go back to my room. I have a headache.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Machado placed his hands flat on the desk. &#x201c;Sorry to hear that. We&#x2019;ll reschedule. Would you like me to get someone to help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Help me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Escort you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your room.&#x201d;<br> <br>He said it like: Where else? Yeah, she got that, got it good. She kept an eye&#x2014;ha!&#x2014;on his hands, flat on the desk: Yes, a complete asshole. Soft, soft hands. They reminded her, the way opposites sometimes will, of those hands that had appeared so suddenly out from under a burqa.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need any help,&#x201d; LeAnne said.</p><h2>All the Best Rubbish: The Classic Ode to Collecting</h2><p><p>One person's trash is another's treasure!</p> <p>In his newly revised classic, <i>All the Best Rubbish</i>, Ivor No�l Hume traces the fascinating history of collecting from its recorded beginnings and describes the remarkable detective work that goes into establishing the probable facts about uncovered and often underappreciated treasures.

We see it everywhere- from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, from the assassination of Kennedy to the death of Diana. In this age of terrorism we live in, the role of conspiracy is a serious one, one that can fuel radical or fringe elements to violence.&nbsp;<br><br>For David Aaronovitch, there came a time when he started to see a pattern among these inflammatory theories. these theories used similarly murky methods with which to insinu�ate their claims: they linked themselves to the supposed conspiracies of the past (it happened then so it can happen now); they carefully manipulated their evidence to hide its holes; they relied on the authority of dubious aca�demic sources. Most important, they elevated their believers to membership of an elite- a group of people able to see beyond lies to a higher reality. But why believe something that entails stretching the bounds of probabil�ity so far?<br><br>In this entertaining and enlightening book, he examines why people believe conspiracy theories, and makes an argument for a true skepticism: one based on a thorough knowledge of history and a strong dose of common sense.</p><p>David Aaronovitch is an award-winning journalist, who has worked in radio, television and newspapers in the United Kingdom since the early 1980s. His first book, <i>Paddling to Jerusalem</i>, won the Madoc prize for travel literature in 2001. He is also the recipient of the George Orwell Prize for political journalism. He writes a regular column for <i>The Times</i> (UK). He lives in north London, with his wife and three daughters.We often wonder if any of the wild conspiracy theories we continually hear about have validity. It turns out that most of them don&#39;t, yet we still wonder: &#34;What if . . . ?&#34; In this serious yet entertaining book, Aaronovitch looks at some of the most important conspiracy theories, how they are constructed, and how they change the way we look at the world (even if we know they&#39;re wrong). James Langton provides a leisurely reading, with his tone and narration well adapted to the serious nature of the book. However, the stereotypical accents he adopts when reading quotes from non-English speakers are not successful. Nevertheless, Langton&#39;s pace is ideal-slow enough to follow complex discussions yet lively enough to maintain interest.

Told by her son, it describes Mary Sherman Morgan&#39;s crucial contribution to launching America&#39;s first satellite and the author&#39;s labyrinthine journey to uncover his mother&#39;s lost legacy--one buried deep under a lifetime of secrets political, technological, and personal.In 1938, a young German rocket enthusiast named Wernher von Braun had dreams of building a rocket that could fly him to the moon. In Ray, North Dakota, a young farm girl named Mary Sherman was attending high school. In an age when girls rarely dreamed of a career in science, Mary wanted to be a chemist. A decade later the dreams of these two disparate individuals would coalesce in ways neither could have imagined.World War II and the Cold War space race with the Russians changed the fates of both von Braun and Mary Sherman Morgan. When von Braun and other top engineers could not find a solution to the repeated failures that plagued the nascent US rocket program, North American Aviation, where Sherman Morgan then worked, was given the challenge. Recognizing her talent for chemistry, company management turned the assignment over to young Mary.In the end, America succeeded in launching rockets into space, but only because of the joint efforts of the brilliant farm girl from North Dakota and the famous German scientist. While von Braun went on to become a high-profile figure in NASA&#39;s manned space flight, Mary Sherman Morgan and her contributions fell into obscurity--until now.</p><p><b>George D.

They focus on the relationships between men and women, as in the poignant fantasy of 'A Parisian Affair', between brothers and sisters, and between masters and servants. Through these relationships, Maupassant explores the dualistic nature of the human character and his stories reveal both nobility, civility and generosity, and, in stories such as 'At Sea' and 'Boule de Suif', vanity, greed and hypocrisy. Maupassant's stories repeatedly lay humanity bare with deft wit and devastating honesty.<br><br>Si�n Miles's vibrant new translation is accompanied by an Introduction discussing Maupassant's stpries as a reflection of the rapidly changing beliefs of his society.

Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Winston Churchill were in attendance, along with thousands of Britons who were all convinced of the unfailing superiority of English bloodstock and eager to see a British colt take the victory. They were shocked when a Kentucky-born chestnut named Never Say Die galloped to a two-length triumph at odds of 33&#x2013;1, winning Britain's greatest race and beginning an important shift in the world of Thoroughbred racing.<br><i><br>Never Say Die</i> traces the history of this extraordinary colt, beginning with his foaling in Lexington, Kentucky, when a shot of bourbon whiskey revived him and earned him his name. Author James C. Nicholson also tells the stories of the influential individuals brought together by the horse and his victory&#x2015;from the heir to the Singer sewing machine fortune to the Aga Khan. Most fascinating is the tale of Mona Best of Liverpool, England, whose well-placed bet on the long-shot Derby contender allowed her to open the Casbah Coffee Club. There, her son met musicians John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison and later joined their band.<br><br>Featuring a foreword by the original drummer for the Beatles, Pete Best, this remarkable book reveals how an underdog's surprise victory played a part in the formation of the most successful and influential rock band in history and made the Bluegrass region of Kentucky the center of the international Thoroughbred industry.</p><p><b>James C. Nicholson</b> is the author of <i>The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event</i>."Nicholson has done a very fine job of placing the unique role of Never Say Die in perspective within the specific confines of Thoroughbred racing history, while at the same time explaining how this horse was touched by a vivid array of characters in other social and historical contexts. Who would have imagined that a racehorse would link such diverse institutions as the Singer sewing machine company, the Epsom Derby, and the Beatles?"&#x2015;<i>Edward L.

Half crazed with grief, stricken by epileptic seizures, and erotically obsessed with his stepson's landlady, Dostoevsky is nevertheless intent on unraveling the enigma of Pavel's life. Was the boy a suicide or a murder victim? Did he love his stepfather or despise him? Was he a disciple of the revolutionary Nechaev, who even now is somewhere in St. Petersburg pursuing a dream of apocalyptic violence? As he follows his stepson's ghost&#x2014;and becomes enmeshed in the same demonic conspiracies that claimed the boy&#x2014;Dostoevsky emerges as a figure of unfathomable contradictions: naive and calculating, compassionate and cruel, pious and unspeakably perverse.</p><p>In 1869, an exiled Russian novelist returns to St Petersburg to collect the effects of his dead stepson, Pavel. But the stepson&#39;s incriminating papers have been found by the Tsarist police and the novelist finds himself drawn into an underworld of suspicion, revolution and danger.Born in Cape Town, South Africa, on February 9, 1940, John Michael Coetzee studied first at Cape Town and later at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a Ph.D. degree in literature.

He ran away from home at age fifteen. Three years later, he contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital ward for the old and terminally ill, where he observed first-hand&#x2014;and with unflinching acuity&#x2014;the cruel nature of protracted suffering and death. From the age of twenty-one, everything he wrote was shaped by the urgency of a dying man&#x2019;s testament&#x2014;and where this account of his life ends, his art begins.<br>&nbsp;<br>Included in this edition is <i>My Prizes</i>, a collection of Bernhard&#x2019;s viciously funny and revelatory essays on his later literary life. Here is a portrait of the artist as a prize-winner: laconic, sardonic, shaking his head with biting amusement at the world and at himself.</p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> was born in Holland in 1931 and grew up in Austria. He studied music at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1957 he began a second career, as a playwright, poet, and novelist. The winner of the three most distinguished and coveted literary prizes awarded in Germany, he has become one of the most widely translated and admired writers of his generation. He published nine novels, an autobiography, one volume of poetry, four collections of short stories, and six volumes of plays. Thomas Bernhard died in Austria in 1989.The Grillparzer Prize<br><br>For the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna I had to buy a suit, as I had suddenly realized two hours before the presentation that I couldn&#x2019;t appear at this doubtless extraordinary ceremony in trousers and a pullover, and so I had actually made the decision on the so-called Graben to go to the Kohlmarkt and outfit myself with appropriate formality, to which end, based on previous shopping for socks on several occasions, I picked the best-known gentleman&#x2019;s outfitters with the descriptive name Sir Anthony, if I remember correctly it was nine forty-five when I went into Sir Anthony&#x2019;s salon, the award ceremony for the Grillparzer Prize was at eleven, so I had plenty of time. I intended to buy myself the best pure-wool suit in anthracite, even if it was off the peg, with matching socks, a tie, and an Arrow shirt in fine cloth, striped gray and blue. The difficulty of initially making oneself understood in the so-called finer emporiums is well-known, even if the customer immediately says what he&#x2019;s looking for in the most concise terms, at first he&#x2019;ll be stared at incredulously until he repeats what he wants. But naturally the salesman he&#x2019;s talking to hasn&#x2019;t taken it in yet. So it took longer than it need have that time in Sir Anthony to be led to the relevant racks. In fact the arrangement of this shop was already familiar to me from buying socks there and I myself knew better than the salesman where to find the suit I was looking for. I walked over to the rack with the suits in question and pointed to one particular example, which the salesman took down from the rod to hold up for my inspection. I checked the quality of the material and even tried it on in the dressing room. I bent forward several times and leaned back and found that the trousers fit. I put on the jacket, turned around several times in front of the mirror, raised my arms and lowered them again, the jacket fit like the trousers. I walked around the shop in the suit a little bit, and took the opportunity to find the shirt and the socks. Finally I said I would keep the suit on, and I also wanted to put on the shirt and the socks. I found a tie, put it on, tightened it as much as I could, inspected myself once more in the mirror, paid, and went out. They had packed my old trousers and pullover in a bag with &#x201c;Sir Anthony&#x201d; on it, so with this bag in my hand, I crossed the Kohlmarkt to meet my aunt, with whom I was going to rendezvous in the Gerstner Restaurant on the K�rnterstrasse, up on the second floor. We wanted to eat a sandwich in order to forestall any malaise or even fainting episode during the proceedings. My aunt had already been to Gerstner&#x2019;s, she had already classified my sartorial transformation as acceptable, and uttered her famous well, all right. Until this moment I hadn&#x2019;t worn a suit for years, yes until then I had always appeared in nothing but trousers and pullover, even to the theater if I went at all, I only went in trousers and pullover, mainly in gray wool trousers and a bright red, coarse-knit sheep&#x2019;s-wool pullover that a well-disposed American had given me right after the war. In this outfit, I remember, I had traveled to Venice several times and gone to the famous theater at La Fenice, once to a production of Monteverdi&#x2019;s Tancredi directed by Vittorio Gui, and I had been with these trousers and pullover in Rome, in Palermo, in Taormina, and in Florence, and in almost all the other capitals of Europe, apart from the fact that I have almost always worn these articles of clothing at home, the shabbier the trousers and pullover, the more I loved them, for years people only saw me in these trousers and this pullover, I&#x2019;ve worn these pieces of clothing for more than a quarter of a century. Suddenly, on the Graben as I said and two hours before the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize, I found these pieces of clothing, which had grown in these decades to be a second skin, to be unsuitable for an honor connected with the name Grillparzer which would take place in the Academy of Sciences. Sitting down in the Gerstner I suddenly had the feeling the trousers were too tight for me, I thought it&#x2019;s probably the way all new trousers feel, and the jacket suddenly felt too tight and also as regards the jacket, I thought this is normal. I ordered a sandwich and drank a glass of beer with it. So who had won this so-called Grillparzer Prize before me, asked my aunt, and for the moment the only name that came to me was Gerhart Hauptmann, I&#x2019;d read that once and that was the occasion I learned of the existence of the Grillparzer Prize for the first time. The prize is not awarded regularly, only on a case-by-case basis, I said, and I thought that it was now six or seven years between awards, maybe sometimes only five, I didn&#x2019;t know exactly, I still don&#x2019;t know today. Also this awarding of the prize was naturally making me nervous and I tried to distract myself and my aunt from the fact that there was only half an hour before the ceremony began, I described the outrageousness of my deciding on the Graben to buy a suit for the ceremony and that it had been self-evident that I would find the shop on the Kohlmarkt which stocks English suits by Chester Barry and Burberry. Why, I had asked myself again, shouldn&#x2019;t I buy a top-quality suit, even if it is off the peg, and now the suit I was wearing was a suit made by Barry. My aunt again only focused on the material and was happy with the English quality. Again she said her famous well, all right. About the cut, nothing. It was classic. She was very happy about the fact that the Academy of Sciences was awarding me that Grillparzer Prize today, she said, and proud, but more happy than proud, and she got to her feet and I followed her out of the Gerstner and down onto the street. We had only a few steps to walk to the Academy of Sciences. The bag with &#x201c;Sir Anthony&#x201d; on it had become deeply repellent to me, but I couldn&#x2019;t change things. I&#x2019;ll hand over the bag before going into the Academy of Sciences, I thought. Some friends who didn&#x2019;t want to miss me being honored were also on their way, we met them in the entrance hall of the Academy. A lot of people were already gathered there and it looked as if the hall was already full. The friends left us in peace and we looked around the hall for some important person to greet us. I walked up and down the entrance hall of the Academy several times with my aunt, but nobody took even the slightest notice of us. So let&#x2019;s go in, I said, and thought, inside the hall some important person will greet me and lead me to the appropriate place with my aunt. Everything in the hall indicated tremendous festiveness and I literally had the sensation that my knees were trembling. My aunt, too, kept looking, as I did, for an important person to greet us. In vain. So we simply stood in the entrance to the hall and waited. But people were pushing past us and kept bumping into us and we had to recognize that we had chosen the least suitable place to wait. Well, is no one going to receive us? we thought. We looked around. The hall was already just about packed and all for the sole purpose of my being awarded the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences, I thought. And no one is greeting me and my aunt. At the age of eighty-one she looked wonderful, elegant, intelligent, and in these moments she seemed to be brave as never before. Now various musicians from the Philharmonic had also taken their places at the front of the podium and everything was pointing to the beginning of the ceremony. But not one person had taken any notice of us, who were supposed to be the centerpiece. So I suddenly had an idea: we&#x2019;ll just go in, I said to my aunt, and sit in the middle of the hall where there are still a few free seats, and we&#x2019;ll wait. We went into the hall and found those free seats in the middle of the hall, many people had to stand and complained to us as we forced our way past them. So now we were sitting in the tenth or eleventh row in the middle of the hall of the Academy of Sciences and we waited. All the so-called guests of honor had now taken their places. But of course the ceremony didn&#x2019;t begin. And only I and my aunt knew why. Up front on the podium at ever-decreasing intervals excited gentlemen were running this way and that as if they were looking for something, namely me. The running this way and that by the gentlemen on the podium went on for a while, during which unrest was already breaking out in the hall. In the meantime the Minister for Sciences had arrived and taken her seat in the front row. She was greeted by the President of the Academy, whose name was Hunger, and led to her chair. A whole line of other so-called dignitaries who were unknown to me were greeted and led to the first or second row. Suddenly I saw a gentleman on the podium whisper something into the ear of another gentleman while simultaneously pointing into the tenth or eleventh row with an outstretched hand, I was the only one who knew he was pointing at me. What happened next is as follows: The gentleman who had whispered something into the ear of the other gentleman and pointed at me went down into the hall and right to my row and made his way along to me. Yes, he said, why are you sitting here when you&#x2019;re the most important person in this celebration and not up front in the first row where we, he actually said we, where we have reserved two places for you and your companion? Yes, why? he asked again and it seemed as if all eyes in the hall were on me and the gentleman. The President, said the gentleman, is asking you please to come to the front, so please come to the front, your seat is right next to the Minister, Herr Bernhard. Yes I said if it&#x2019;s that simple, but naturally I will only go into the first row if President Hunger has requested me personally to do so, it goes without saying only if President Hunger is inviting me personally to do so. My aunt said nothing during this scene and the guests of the ceremony all looked at us and the gentleman went back along the whole row and then toward the front and whispered something from beside the Minister into President Hunger&#x2019;s ear. After this there was much unrest in the hall, only the tuning-up by the players from the Philharmonic stopped it from becoming something really ugly and I saw that President Hunger was laboriously making his way toward me. Now is the time to stand firm, I thought, demonstrate my intransigence, courage, single-mindedness. I&#x2019;m not going to go and meet them, I thought, just as (in the deepest sense of the word) they didn&#x2019;t meet me. When President Hunger reached me, he said he was sorry, what he was sorry for, he didn&#x2019;t say. Please would I be kind enough to come with my aunt to the front row, my seat and my aunt&#x2019;s were between the Minister and him. So my aunt and I followed President Hunger into the front row. When we had sat down and an indefinable murmur had spread throughout the hall, the ceremony could begin. I think the men from the Philharmonic played a piece by Mozart. Then there were several longer or shorter speeches about Grillparzer. The one time I glanced over at Minister Firnberg, that was her name, she had fallen asleep, which hadn&#x2019;t escaped President Hunger either, for the Minister was snoring, even if very quietly, she was snoring, she was snoring the quiet, world-famous ministerial snore. My aunt was following the so-called ceremony with the greatest attention, when some turn of phrase in one of the speeches sounded too stupid or even too comical, she gave me a complicit glance. The two of us were having our own experience. Finally, after about an hour and a half, President Hunger stood up and went to the podium and announced the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize to me. He read out a few words of praise about my work, not without naming some titles of plays that were supposed to be by me but which I hadn&#x2019;t actually written, and listed a row of European famous names who had been singled out for the prize before me. Herr Bernhard was receiving the prize for his play A Feast for Boris, said Hunger (the play that had been appallingly badly acted a year before by the Burgtheater company in the Academy Theater), and then, as if to embrace me, he opened his arms wide. The signal for me to step onto the podium had arrived. I stood up and went to Hunger. He shook my hand and gave me a so-called award certificate of a tastelessness, like every other award certificate I have ever received, that was beyond comparison. I hadn&#x2019;t intended to say anything on the podium, I hadn&#x2019;t been asked to do so at all. So in order to choke off my embarrassment, I said a brief Thank you! and went back down into the hall and sat down. Whereupon Herr Hunger also sat down and the musicians from the Philharmonic played a piece by Beethoven. While the musicians from the Phil- harmonic were playing, I thought over the entire ceremony now ending, whose peculiarity and tastelessness and mindlessness naturally had not yet had the chance to register in my consciousness. The musicians from the Philharmonic had barely finished playing when up stood Minister Firnberg and, immediately, President Hunger and both of them went to the podium. Now everyone in the hall had stood up and was pushing toward the podium, toward the Minister naturally and President Hunger who was talking to the Minister. I stood with my aunt, dumbfounded and increasingly at a loss, and we listened to the rising hubbub of a myriad of voices. After a time the Minister looked around and asked in a voice in which inimitable arrogance competed with stupidity: So, where is the little poet? I had been standing right next to her but I didn&#x2019;t dare to make myself known. I took my aunt and we left the hall. Unhindered and without a single person having taken any notice of us, we left the Academy of Sciences at around one o&#x2019;clock. Outside, friends were waiting for us. With these friends, we went to have lunch in the place called the G�sser Bierklinik. A philosopher, an architect, their wives, and my brother. All entertaining people. I no longer remember what we ate. When I was asked during the meal how large the prize money was, it was the first time I really took in the fact that the prize had no money attached to it at all. My own humiliation then struck me as common impudence. But it&#x2019;s one of the greatest honors that can be bestowed on an Austrian, to receive the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences, said someone at the table, I think it was the architect. It was huge, said the philosopher. My brother, as always on such occasions, said nothing. After the meal I suddenly had the feeling that the newly bought suit was far too tight and went into the shop on the Kohlmarkt, Sir Anthony I mean, and said to them in a fairly brash way but still with perfect politeness that I wished to exchange the suit, I had just bought the suit, as they knew, but it was at least one size too small. It was my firmness that made the salesman I was speaking to go straight to the rack from which my suit had come. Without objection he let me slip into the same suit but one size larger and I immediately felt that this suit fit. How could I have thought only a few hours ago that the one-size-smaller suit fit me? I clutched my head. Now I was wearing the suit that actually fit and I left the shop with the greatest sense of relief. Whoever buys the suit I have just returned, I thought, has no idea that it&#x2019;s been with me at the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna. It was an absurd thought, and at this absurd thought I took heart. I spent a most enjoyable day with my aunt and we kept laughing over the people at Sir Anthony, who had let me exchange my suit without objections, although I had already worn it to the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize in the Academy of Sciences. That they were so obliging is something...</p><h2>Uncle John&#39;s Second Bathroom Reader</h2><p><p>It's Time For #2~</p><p>That's right!...We're back flushed with the success of Uncle John's first <i>Bathroom Reader</i>!

His teachings set the course of Chinese society for 2,500 years. But Confucius remains merely a name to many readers, rather than the central figure of world history that he deserves to be. Now award-winning author-illustrator Demi illuminates his life and influence in this elegant biography that will appeal to readers of all ages. <p> Confucius loved books and learning, but he grew up during a time of great suffering and warfare in China. Troubled by the chaos he saw all around him, he devoted his life to reforming his society and government, with ideas about education and leadership that still resonate today. He encouraged everyone -- especially rulers -- to live moral lives, emphasizing the value of tradition and compassion. And five hundred years before Jesus set forth his Golden Rule, Confucius declared his Golden Mean: "Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself."</p></p><p><p>DEMI is an author and illustrator of more than one hundred books for children, mostly biographies and folklore. She is known for her perceptive texts and elegant illustrations with golden accents, and her books have received numerous awards and accolades, among them ALA Notable Children's Books, <em>The New York Times </em>Best Illustrated Books, Notable Books for a Global Society, <em>American Bookseller</em> Pick of the Lists, the Middle East Book Award, and the Christopher Award, which recognizes individuals whose work makes a positive difference in the world. Demi has traveled extensively and studied art in Mexico, India, and China. She lives with her husband in Carnation, Washington.</p> <p></p>This deftly illustrated picture book introduces Confucius, the great Chinese philosopher and teacher, to young readers. In the preface, the author clarifies that Confucius' life is "shrouded in legend," hence the juxtaposition of mythological and realistic characters to tell his story. It starts before Confucius was born, when a mythological creature, the qilin, presents Confucius' mother with a jade tablet engraved with the words "Your child will be a king without a crown." Confucius' potential for greatness is obvious from boyhood. He believes in the importance of ritual, and of all his activities, "he love[s] reading and studying most." As an adult, Confucius sees despair in the world around him and decides the best way to influence society is through education and eventually opens a school. He welcomes not only the wealthy, but also the poor, believing everyone should be given a chance to lead, and his teachings emphasize the need to govern with compassion and just behavior. Demi incorporates her subject's own words, taken from various translations of his Analects, throughout her account. Hues of blue, red, and her signature gold pop from the flat, two-dimensional scenes, which are framed in auspicious colors of red and gold. The lack of depth and perspective and the inclusion of symbolic creatures recall traditional Chinese paintings. An appealing biography done in classic Demi tradition, suitable for readers interested in Confucianism and its impact on Chinese culture and values. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Illustrating in a delicate style that strongly evokes her ancient Chinese setting, Demi introduces the life and teachings of Confucius (known as Kongzi in China), blending facts and legends surrounding the educator and philosopher. Mythical stories surround Confucius s birth ( One adds that a comet, two protective dragons, and five old men representing the planets and stars appeared in the sky to celebrate ), and Demi explains how his desire to bring order to the social and political turmoil of his era led him to enter government. But his true triumphs came through teaching, and Demi incorporates his philosophies throughout ( In both government and private life, perhaps the most important word to Confucius was shu... which means compassion or open-heartedness ), giving readers a rich understanding of his beliefs and impact. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Ludwig Bemelmans: The Illustrators</h2><p><p><strong>An inaugural title in a new series showcasing the most significant illustrators of the modern era, this book explores the work of Ludwig Bemelmans.</strong></p><p>Recognized most widely as the creator and illustrator of the beloved children&#x2019;s classic <em>Madeline</em>, Ludwig Bemelmans (1898&#x2013;1962) also wrote and illustrated a number of other children&#x2019;s books, novels, short stories, and travel books.

As a result, people are often unprepared to answer the difficult questions that confront them today: - Is abortion ever justifiable? - If a loved one is suffering, can we take action that might relieve their suffering but will hasten their death? - Should doctors be allowed to help patients who wish to end their lives? - If a child is severely impaired, can we allow her to die rather than face a life of suffering? - Should we use genetic therapy to enhance the human race? - Should we seriously consider cloning human beings?

Patience Goodspeed, almost thirteen years old, departs from Nantucket aboard her father's whaling ship. Between kitchen duty and whale blubber stench, this voyage is far from a pleasure cruise. At least Papa lets Patience assist the ship's navigator since she's so good at calculations. <br> But the smooth sailing doesn't last long. Mutinous mates maroon most of the crew, including Patience's father and brother, on a deserted island. Can Patience rescue everyone before it's too late?</p><p>Heather Vogel Frederick is the award-winning author of the Mother-Daughter Book Club series,&nbsp;the Pumpkin Falls Mystery series, the Patience Goodspeed books, the Spy Mice series, and&nbsp;<i>Once Upon a Toad</i>. An avid fan of small towns like Pumpkin Falls, Heather and her husband live in New England, close to where Heather grew up. You can learn more about the author and her books at HeatherVogelFrederick.com.With the clever, nearly 13-year-old narrator, Patience, at the helm, this fast-paced debut novel successfully steers through a whaling expedition and mutinous uprising. Though Patience would rather honor her recently deceased Mama's plan that she study mathematics at home on Nantucket, her captain father insists she and her six-year-old brother, Thaddeus (Tad), accompany him on his whaling ship. However, once aboard the Morning Star, her father initially dismisses her interest in navigation until she proves herself in her lessons (she also demonstrates her talents in the galley the author includes two favorite recipes). Frederick spices up the journey with an eclectic cast and crew, including Glum the dour cook, two thugs Patience nicknames Bunion and Toad, and a traitor named Bridgewater whom she dubs Bilgewater. She also weaves into the plot atmospheric details about whaling, the layout of the ship and navigational instruments, and supplements her research with facts about infamous whaling vessels such as the Essex and insider terms that kids will eat up, such as "Nantucket sleigh ride" the whalers' name for the breakneck chase after the prey. Patience also keeps a diary, which in some instances offers a slightly revised rehash of events but, for the most part, complements the text. Though readers will enjoy the whaling adventure, the brave heroine makes this historical adventure most memorable.

As Julio Capo Jr. shows in this fascinating history, Miami's transnational connections reveal that the city has been a queer borderland for over a century. In chronicling Miami's queer past from its 1896 founding through 1940, Capo shows the multifaceted ways gender and sexual renegades made the city their own.<br><br>Drawing from a multilingual archive, Capo unearths the forgotten history of "fairyland," a marketing term crafted by boosters that held multiple meanings for different groups of people. In viewing Miami as a contested colonial space, he turns our attention to migrants and immigrants, tourism, and trade to and from the Caribbean--particularly the Bahamas, Cuba, and Haiti--to expand the geographic and methodological parameters of urban and queer history. Recovering the world of Miami's old saloons, brothels, immigration checkpoints, borders, nightclubs, bars, and cruising sites, Capo makes clear how critical gender and sexual transgression is to understanding the city and the broader region in all its fullness.<br>***<b>Awards and Honors</b><ul><li>Winner, 2018 Charles S.

Marginalized for its "radical" position that the human races were equal, Firmin's lucid and persuasive treatise was decades ahead of its time. Arguing that the equality of the races could be demonstrated through a positivist scientific approach, Firmin challenged racist writings and the dominant views of the day. Translated by Asselin Charles and framed by Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban's substantial introduction, this rediscovered text is an important contribution to contemporary scholarship in anthropology, pan-African studies, and colonial and postcolonial studies.<b>Ant�nor Firmin</b> (1850-1911) was born and educated in Haiti. He studied law and held several political offices before being posted as a diplomat to Paris, where he was admitted to the Societ� d'Anthropologie de Paris and wrote De L'�galit� des Races Humaines.

Some of those obstacles are intellectual, but there are emotional, relational and experiential ones as well. Even theological problems can get in the way when the very nature of faith itself is misunderstood. J. P. Moreland and Klaus Issler team up in this book to clear away the barriers to faith by helping you gain a clear grasp of what faith is, identifying the various obstacles to it and providing guidance for growing in your trust in God through Jesus Christ.</p><p>J. P. Moreland (PhD, University of Southern California) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California. He is the author, coauthor, or contributor to over ninety-five books, including <em>Does God Exist?</em>, <em>Universals</em>, <em>The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology</em>, <em>Consciousness and the Existence of God</em>, <em>Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview</em>, <em>In Search of a Confident Faith</em>, <em>Love Your God With All Your Mind</em>, <em>The God Question</em>, and <em>Debating Christian Theism</em>. In his distinguished career, Moreland has co-planted three churches, spoken and debated on over 175 college campuses around the country, and served with Campus Crusade for Christ for ten years. The founder and director of Eidos Christian Center, he also previously served as a bioethicist for PersonaCare Nursing Homes, Inc. headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. Moreland&#x2019;s ideas have been covered by both popular religious and non-religious outlets, including the <em>New Scientist</em>, <em>Christianity Today</em>, PBS's "Closer to Truth," and <em>WORLD</em> magazine. In 2016 Moreland was selected by The Best Schools as one of the "50 most influential living philosophers.""Moreland and Issler show how and why ancient theologians spoke of three elements of faith: <em>notitia</em> (knowledge, doctrinal understanding), <em>assensus</em> (confidence that Christianity is true), and <em>fiducia</em> (commitment which involves living a life that reflects the truth)." (Marvin Olasky, World Magazine, March 13, 2010)<br><br>"<em>In Search of a Confident Faith</em> is an excellent book. It patiently defines terms; supports its arguments through Scripture and reason; is richly illustrated with salient personal testimony; and provides wise advice for believers. I recommend this book to any Christian interested in strengthening his faith, but especially to high school grads, college and graduate school students, and pastors." (George Wood, AG Think Tank (agthinktank.com), December 2008)<br><br>"This is no light treatment but a balanced look at 'God-confidence,' as the authors replace the slandered word 'faith.' It made me examine facets of faith I had not studied before. I was challenged by this book, and I like where God is leading me through it." (George Henson, Baptist Standard, December 15, 2008)<br><br>"Faith has an expansive horizon. It is not merely about believing the right things. Instead, it inhabits every dimension of our personhood--how we think, how we behave, how we deal with our emotions and how we relate to others. We owe Moreland and Issler a great debt of gratitude for expanding the faith horizon in a way that will encourage many to actively grow their faith, their confidence in God." (David Neff, editor-in-chief, Christianity Today)<br><br>"Moreland and Issler demonstrate how critical thinking and heartfelt religion go hand in hand, while encouraging God-confidence in the lives of Christians. Drawing upon their personal experiences as well as a lifetime of commitment to higher education, the authors model a spiritual balance too often neglected in understanding the dynamic relationship between Christian faith, hope and love." (Don Thorsen, professor of theology and chair of advanced studies, Haggard Graduate School of Theology, Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>"<em>In Search of a Confident Faith</em> is a delightful exploration of developing one's trust in an ever-faithful God. Moreland and Issler offer candid glimpses into their personal faith walk and their struggle to find balance between 'head' faith and 'heart' faith. This book provides an important contribution toward understanding the development of personal confident faith in those traditions that tend to dichotomize head and heart in all religious matters, giving permission to both traditions to embrace the other. In addition to an eloquent articulation of faith which integrates intellect and affection, Issler and Moreland offer the reader practical suggestions for personal growth in God-confidence. A must-read for all those concerned with Christian spiritual formation!" (Lisa Milligan Long, assistant professor of Christian formation, Lee University, Cleveland, Tennessee)<br><br>"The volume is an invitation from Father God for his beloved children to live by faith, which the authors clarify through the term <em>God-confidence.</em> J. P. Moreland and Klaus Issler, not only as distinguished scholars but also as 'credible witnesses' of God's supernatural activities among us, present a well-balanced treatment in guiding believers to grow in God-confidence through changes in their beliefs and daily practices." (Linda Pyun, associate dean for academic affairs, The King's College, Los Angeles)<br><br>"Many books focus on either intellectual or emotional barriers to faith. What makes this one unique is the profound way it combines both. In addition to identifying and helping us remove barriers, it also includes many practical, positive strategies for building our God-confidence. As I read it, I found myself not only being informed, but also being inspired. Often I found myself praying, 'Lord, increase my faith.' I am confident you will too." (Stephen A. Seamands, professor of Christian doctrine, Asbury Theological Seminary)<br><br>"We live in a world dominated by a kind of practical atheism. Some of us may vaguely believe in God or even trust Christ as our Savior, but still think and act as if God was not really present. We need a robust faith that sees beyond the moment and brings forth lives lived in the conscious presence of a God who is engaged with the world. J. P. Moreland and Klaus Issler call this God-confidence. Their counsel on how to move toward such a faith is biblically based, theologically and philosophically sound, and experientially confirmed. This is a book to grow on." (James W. Sire, author of The Universe Next Door and coauthor with Carl Peraino of Deepest Differences: A Christian-Atheist Dialogue)<br><br>"Rich in story, here is a work that creatively unfolds the heart of faith as confidence in God, with helpful implications for matters of doubt, prayer and guidance." (Bruce Demarest, professor of theology and spiritual formation, Denver Seminary, Denver, Colorado)</p><h2>How Shostakovich Changed My Mind</h2><p><b>A powerful look at the extraordinary healing effect of music on sufferers of mental illness, including author Stephen Johnson's struggle with bipolar disorder.</b><br><br>BBC music broadcaster Stephen Johnson explores the power of Shostakovich&#x2019;s music during Stalin&#x2019;s reign of terror, and writes of the extraordinary healing effect of music on sufferers of mental illness. Johnson looks at neurological, psychotherapeutic and philosophical findings, and reflects on his own experience, where he believes Shostakovich&#x2019;s music helped him survive the trials and assaults of bipolar disorder.<br><br>There is no escapism, no false consolation in Shostakovich&#x2019;s greatest music: this is some of the darkest, saddest, at times bitterest music ever composed. So why do so many feel grateful to Shostakovich for having created it&#x2014;not just Russians, but westerners like Stephen Johnson, brought up in a very different, far safer kind of society? The book includes interviews with the members of the orchestra who performed Shostakovich&#x2019;s Leningrad Symphony during the siege of that city.</p><p><b>Stephen Johnson&nbsp;</b>has taken part in several hundred radio programs and documentaries, including Radio 3&#x2019;s weekly series&nbsp;<i>Discovering Music</i>.

Johnson argues that Shostakovich...testified on behalf of fellow humanity, his music concerned with &#x2018;we&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;I&#x2019;. Part of Shostakovich&#x2019;s attraction is that while he suffers he knows&#x2014;and reminds his fellow sufferers&#x2014;that we do not suffer alone.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>BBC Music Magazine</i> <br><br>"Strangely, anguished music can be the most comforting: using a delicate, self-deprecating style and references encompassing everything from Greek drama to the Moomins, Johnson explores the way Shostakovich provides catharsis, transforming the personal &#x2018;I&#x2019; into the collective &#x2018;we.&#x2019; Profoundly moving."<i> &#x2014;<i>The Sunday Times</i></i>, &#x201c;The Best Classical Music Books of 2018&#x201d; <br><br>"<i>How Shostakovich Changed my Mind</i> is short enough and eloquent enough to read comfortably at a single two-hour stretch, without skipping over a single word ...

I finished it inspired by a sense of human possibility.&#x201d; &#x2014;Raymond Tallis</p><h2>Heroes of the Middle Ages (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Recounts the stories of the most important movements in the history of Europe during the Middle Ages and acquaints the reader with the most important figures in those scenes. The figures are grouped into seven periods: The Barbarian Invasion, The Forming of the Germanic Nations, The Teutonic Invasions, The Rise of Nationalities, The Crusades, The Time of Progress and Discovery, and The Struggles of the Nations. In the tapestry which the author weaves may be traced the history of the rise and fall of the various nationalities and the circumstances and mode of life of each.</p><p></p><h2>Occasions (New Series of Lifestyle Books)</h2><p>Every occasion calls out for something extra, whether it's flowers you set on the table, foods to honor a special gathering, or the selection of music. For both hostess and guest, consideration of those around you is among the most important qualities for any enjoyable occasion. A smile and sense of humor are also essential, and before the canap�s and night lighting a good hostess is ultimately defined by a welcoming and gracious demeanor. <br> In <i>Occasions,</i> designer Kate Spade invites you into her world of easy, festive entertaining, where the emphasis is not on "the perfect meal" but on having "the perfect time." It's a world where laughter and conversation at dinner parties are encouraged and where spilled red wine on the couch is no reason to stop the music. As Kate says, "Making your guests feel at home is truly an art and it's one worth cultivating." <br> Any occasion begins with preparation, and at the outset Kate describes such basic components as lighting (votive candles are a must); table linens, flatware, and glassware; flowers (trimmed short and tightly massed); even bedding for overnight or weekend guests. Party shopping lists, hors d'oeuvres and cocktail favorites, and dinner party menus are all included. An "Alphabet of Special Events," from baby showers to tailgate picnics, is both anecdotal and useful for would-be hostesses everywhere. <br> Whether you entertain a lot or a little, and whether your style is casual or formal, <i>Occasions,</i> with more than 230 charming watercolor illustrations, is a handy and fresh approach to the subject, a book to be treasured today and over the years. Above all, at any gathering "hospitality makes for infectious fun."</p><p>Back in 1993, the editor-turned-designer Kate Spade made a splash in the fashion world by turning out a small collection of boxy, utilitarian handbags, each elegantly accented with her name stitched in discreet, lowercase letters. As a result, the simplicity and unabashed refinement of the Spade moniker on those Lilliputian labels has come to define the very foundation on which the designer has since built a fashion empire, one that now, in addition to handbags, includes shoes, clothing, and smart home things, all of which embody the Spade formula of timeless style--a seamless merging of cheerful colors, clean shapes, and well-chosen embellishments. <p> Not bad for a Kansas City-born girl who used to comb vintage stores for fun. Having perfected and expertly marketed her own brand of personal style (one that has famously been counterfeited throughout the world), the designer has emerged with an equally elegant trio of books whose topics Spade has become a virtual authority: <i>Style</i>, <i>Occasions</i>, and <i>Manners</i>.</p><p> Applying a personal touch to everything you do is Spade's mantra, and leads us off to parties big and small in <i>Occasions</i>. Just like its sister volumes <i>Style</i> and <i>Manners</i>, <i>Occasions</i> has the spirit of a light-hearted scrapbook, but it still packs a bounty of inspired entertaining ideas into its slim proportions. From classic cocktail recipes and setting a sparkling table to seasonal menus, party themes, and the art of the perfect toast, Spade offers all the ingredients for making a party memorable (and maintaining grace under pressure). While she often spotlights the wisdom and flair of famous party stars she loves (Truman Capote and his Black &amp; White ball among them), Spade in her own words resonates as the real tastemaker, getting the balance between girl-next-door and bon vivant just right. <i>--Christene Barberich</i></p>Kate Spade grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. After graduation she went to Mademoiselle magazine and became senior fashion editor/head of accessories before leaving in 1991. In 1993 she and her boyfriend, now husband, Andy Spade launched kate spade handbags, which has grown exponentially over the past decade and has established Kate Spade as a style icon.</p><h2>Dictionary of Christian Spirituality</h2><p><p>In recent decades Christian spirituality, spiritual formation and spiritual theology have become important concepts in the global evangelical community. Consequently, an accessible and reliable academic resource is needed on these topics&#x2014;one that will offer a discerning orientation to the wealth of ecumenical resources available while still highlighting the distinct heritage and affirming the core grace-centered values of classic evangelical spirituality. The Dictionary of Christian Spirituality reflects an overarching interpretive framework for evangelical spiritual formation: a holistic and grace-filled spirituality that encompasses relational (connecting), transformational (becoming), and vocational (doing) dynamics. At the same time, contributors respectfully acknowledge the differences between Reformed, Holiness, and Pentecostal paradigms of the spiritual life. And, by bringing together writers from around the world who share a common orthodoxy, this reference work is truly global and international in both its topical scope and contributors. Entries give appropriate attention to concepts, concerns, and formative figures in the evangelical tradition of spirituality that other reference work neglect. They offer a discerning orientation to the wealth of ecumenical resources available, exploring the similarities and differences between Christianity and alternate spiritualities without lapsing into relativism. The Dictionary of Christian Spirituality is a resource that covers a wide range of topics relating to Christian spirituality and is biblically engaged, accessible, and relevant for all contemporary Christians.</p></p><p>Glen G.

Papa Gatto is a clever cat who serves as an adviser to the prince. He allows himself to be misled by a pretty face when he engages an attractive young woman, Sophia, to care for his motherless kittens?she turns out to be a nasty piece of work. Later, her stepsister Beatrice proves that a beautiful character is often concealed behind a plain exterior. Papa Gatto recommends Beatrice to the prince, who is looking for a wife, and when Sophia tries to trick him into marrying her, the wise cat literally uncovers her deception. Sanderson cites several sources for her tale, and the story she weaves is faithful to them yet original. The narrative develops at a leisurely pace, and the attempted deception adds suspense. Beatrice's decision to delay marriage with the prince until she gets to know him comes across as thoughtful and natural, and the story is satisfying overall. The oil paintings glow with warm, rich tones. Sanderson pays meticulous attention to detail and captures the mood perfectly. Only the depiction of Beatrice is a little jarring; she does not appear as plain as the text indicates, but perhaps her portrayal is intended to underscore how outside opinion can influence self-perception.

Humans have been farming for thousands of years, and yet agriculture has undergone more fundamental changes in the past 80 years than in the previous several centuries. In 1900, 30 million American farmers tilled the soil or tended livestock; today there are fewer than 4.5 million farmers who feed a population four times larger than it was at the beginning of the century. Fifty years ago, the planet could not have sustained a population of 6.5 billion; now, commercial and industrial agriculture ensure that millions will not die from starvation. Farmers are able to feed an exponentially growing planet because the greatest industrial revolution in history has occurred in agriculture since 1929, with U.S. farmers leading the way. Productivity on American farms has increased tenfold, even as most small farmers and tenants have been forced to find other work. Today, only 300,000 farms produce approximately ninety percent of the total output, and overproduction, largely subsidized by government programs and policies, has become the hallmark of modern agriculture. A Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929 charts the profound changes in farming that have occurred during author Paul K. Conkin&#39;s lifetime. His personal experiences growing up on a small Tennessee farm complement compelling statistical data as he explores America&#39;s vast agricultural transformation and considers its social, political, and economic consequences. He examines the history of American agriculture, showing how New Deal innovations evolved into convoluted commodity programs following World War II. Conkin assesses the skills, new technologies, and government policies that helped transform farming in America and suggests how new legislation might affect farming in decades to come. Although the increased production and mechanization of farming has been an economic success story for Americans, the costs are becoming increasingly apparent. Small farmers are put out of business when they cannot compete with giant, non-diversified corporate farms. Caged chickens and hogs in factory-like facilities or confined dairy cattle require massive amounts of chemicals and hormones ultimately ingested by consumers. Fertilizers, new organic chemicals, manure disposal, and genetically modified seeds have introduced environmental problems that are still being discovered. A Revolution Down on the Farm concludes with an evaluation of farming in the twenty-first century and a distinctive meditation on alternatives to our present large scale, mechanized, subsidized, and fossil fuel and chemically dependent system.</p><p><p>Agriculture has undergone more fundamental changes in the past eighty years than in its entire previous history.

In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc.

But what do other animals do? Sixteen wonderfully diverse animals, each with its own way of dealing with water, plunge, paddle, and propel themselves across the double-page spreads. Richly textured, full-color paper collages are accompanied by short rhyming sentences. "Hippos sink to the bottom to sleep. Wildebeests wade where the water's not deep." The point here: there are many ways to swim. "How about you?" readers are asked at the end. Notes illuminating further facts about each animal's water habits follow. The writing is clear, straightforward, and will stimulate further interest. However, the arbitrary use of male and female pronouns seems forced. "An elephant swims with her whole body," and "seven minutes after a baby wildebeest is born she can run." Armadillos and polar bears are referred to as "he." Nevertheless, the writing is sound and the beauty of the collages alone make this a welcome addition to any collection.?Lisa Wu Stowe, Great Neck Library, NY<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Escape Artists: A Band of Daredevil Pilots and the Greatest Prison Break of the Great War</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Bascomb has unearthed a remarkable piece of hidden history, and told it perfectly.

Frank Bill delivers what is both a wake-up call and a gut punch. Welcome to heartland America circa right about now, when the union jobs and family farms that kept the white on the picket fences have given way to meth labs, backwoods gunrunners, and bare-knuckle brawling. </p><p>Bill's people are pressed to the brink&#x2015;and beyond. There is Scoot McCutchen, whose beloved wife falls terminally ill, leaving him with nothing to live for&#x2015;which doesn't quite explain why he brutally murders her and her doctor and flees, or why, after years of running, he decides to turn himself in. In the title story, a man who has devolved from breeding hounds for hunting to training them for dog-fighting crosses paths with a Salvadoran gangbanger tasked with taking over the rural drug trade, but who mostly wants to grow old in peace. As <i>Crimes in Sourthern Indiana </i>unfolds, we witness the unspeakable, yet are compelled to find sympathy for the depraved. </p><p>Bill's southern Indiana is haunted with the deep, authentic sense of place that recalls the best of Southern fiction, but the interconnected stories bristle with the urban energy of a Chuck Palahniuk or a latter-day Nelson Algren and rush with the slam-bang plotting of pulp-noir crime writing � la Jim Thompson. Bill's prose is gritty yet literary, shocking, and impossible to put down. A dark evocation of the survivalist spirit of the working class, this is a brilliant debut by an important new voice.</p></p><p><p><b>Frank Bill</b> lives and writes in southern Indiana. <i>Crimes in Southern Indiana </i>is his first book.</p><p>&#x201c;Bill's ever violent and never dull stories [are] a blend of Midwest Gothic and country pulp . . . [They're] over the top, but in a good way, in the way that Quentin Tarantino's first film, <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>, was over the top. Bill never cheats on the smells and sounds of carnage. He doesn't spare the kids and the dogs. But he mixes in a dash of dark humor ("The Accident" being the best example), an occasional nod to love and sentiment ("The Penance of Scoot McCutchen"), and he's adept at holding back, offering reward with a fine twist at story's end . . . [T]his book delivers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Seattle Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;The hard- scrabble realism of these 17 stories will bring to mind the Ozark writer Daniel Woodrell and shades of Cormac McCarthy and Dorothy Allison--offering a view of American lives and mores that may as well be from a different planet . . . Rural idyll this is not--but it is as riveting as anything you may read in the near term.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Daily Beast (Best Debuts of the Fall list)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Flowing like awful mud and written in pulpy style, these stories paint a grisly portrait of the author's homeland. You might want to have your brass knuckles handy when reading.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;This gritty, violent debut collection begins rather like pulp genre fiction then deepens into something much more significant and powerful. Set in a dilapidated, seedy, nightmare version of southern Indiana, complete with meth labs, dog-fighting rings, and all manner of substance abuse, the stories are connected by recurring characters. The collection opens with vignettes focused mainly on carnage. But as readers go deeper, the stories lengthen, with Bill turning his attention to psychology and character development and bringing the community to life in fascinating ways ... Bill's characters live in a fractured world where there are no good jobs, not much respect for life, and not much hope. It's a bleak, hard-boiled vision of America.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Good Lord, where in the hell did this guy come from? Blasts off like a frigging rocket ship and hits as hard as an ax handle to the side of the head after you've eaten a live rattlesnake for breakfast. One of the wildest damn rides you're ever going to take inside a book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donald Ray Pollock, author of Knockemstiff</i></p><p>&#x201c;Frank Bill's characters all seem to be hurtling at ninety miles an hour down dead end streets, and his recounting of their passage is vivid and unforgettable. Like Barry Hannah on amphetamines, but the voice is undeniably Bill's own.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William Gay, author of Provinces of Night</i></p><p>&#x201c;What can I say about this book? This: planning a summer trip north from Mississippi, these stories caused me to reroute to avoid Southern Indiana. Mr. Bill knows his people well, and writes like they live--on the edge of the edge. Just plain unforgettable fiction.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tom Franklin, author of Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</i></p><p>&#x201c;When you're composing your hardbitten pantheon--Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, Patricia Highsmith, Big Jim Thompson, Elmore Leonard--save room for Frank Bill, whose Crimes in Southern Indiana reminded me how thrilling and darkly vital crime fiction used to be and is again.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kyle Minor, author of In the Devil's Territory</i></p><p>&#x201c;These stories form the ideal nexus between literary art and pulp fiction: beautifully crafted, compulsively readable, and as addictive as crystal meth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Pinckney Benedict, author of Dogs of God and The Wrecking Yard</i></p><p>&#x201c;Take the bark of a .45, the growl of a rusted-out muffler, and the banshee howl of a methhead on a three-day bender, and you approximate the voice of Frank Bill, a startlingly talented writer whose stories rise from the same dark lyrical well as those of Daniel Woodrell and Dorothy Allison.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Percy, author of The Wilding and Refresh, Refresh</i></p><p>&#x201c;How can I not love a writer whose work reminds me in a huge way of some of my favorite writers: Lansdale, Woodrell, Willeford, Thompson, and Faulkner? Crimes in Southern Indiana is a brutal, hilarious, honest, unforgettable book, and Frank Bill is the freshest new voice to emerge on the crime fiction scene in recent years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jason Starr, author of The Pack</i></p><p>&#x201c;Say you're driving down a country road, midnight, a beer in your lap, and you corner into a two-car head-on collision that's one of the most horrible things you've ever seen, so horrible that you've just gotta stop, and then, say, when you've gotten out and you're poking around the body parts trying to figure out what's what, you turn your head just right and catch the way the moonlight lays glittering over the twisted metal and bloodslick asphalt, and you're struck breathless by the eerie beauty of it all. That's what Frank Bill's writing is like. It's that stark, that brutal, and just that beautiful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Whitmer, author of Pike</i></p><p>&#x201c;Frank Bill does to crime fiction what a rabid pit bull does to his favorite chew toy. You'll need a neck brace after whipping through these wild, wonderful, whacked-out stories.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Derek Nikitas, author of Pyres</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Crimes in Southern Indiana</i> brings to light a major American writer of fiction, the prose equivalent of a performance by Warren Oates or a song by Merle Haggard or a photograph by Walker Evans. Tempting though it is to compare him to other writers, the fact is that five years hence every good new fiction writer to come into view will be compared to Frank Bill.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Scott Phillips, author of The Ice Harvest</i></p><p>&#x201c;The first time I read a story by Frank Bill it was like watching a redneck opera in another language. No idea what was going on, but I was dying to find out. I wanted more, more, more until I finally learned how to speak 'Frank Bill.' He is a completely original voice in the literary arena, and will take on any challengers with his bare hands. I'm continually in awe of the stories he tells and the insane way he tells them.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anthony Neil Smith, author of Yellow Medicine and Hogdoggin'</i></p></p><h2>Forgeries of Memory and Meaning: Blacks and the Regimes of Race in American Theater and Film before World War II</h2><p>Cedric J.

He demonstrates how the needs of American commerce determined the construction of successive racial regimes that were publicized in the theater and in motion pictures, particularly through plantation and jungle films. In addition to providing new depth and complexity to the history of black representation, Robinson examines black resistance to these practices. Whereas D. W. Griffith appropriated black minstrelsy and romanticized a national myth of origins, Robinson argues that Oscar Micheaux transcended uplift films to create explicitly political critiques of the American national myth.

These pressing questions, common to so many, sent Augustine on his own spiritual journey toward the heart of God. The secret joys he found along the way can be yours as you walk the trail he blazed in spirit.Among the best-loved of all Christian expositors, Augustine (354-430 A.D.) struggled to find the true path to God, amid heresy and threats of persecution and destruction. Yet in all his works there shines a heart set on one goal--to become a friend to God, and Him alone. His written words, treasured for centuries, are footprints to be followed to the kind of life that finds God. Ever present. Strong. Life-changing.

Greek philosophers studying in India? Meditation classes in ancient Rome? It sounds unbelievable, but it&#x2019;s historically true. Alexander the Great had an Indian guru. Pythagoras, Empedocles, and Plotinus all encouraged their students to meditate. Apollonius, the most famous Western sage of the first century c.e., visited both India and Egypt and claimed that Egyptian wisdom was rooted in India.<br><br>In <i>Lost Masters</i>, award-winning author Linda Johnsen, digging deep into classical sources, uncovers evidence of astonishing similarities between some of the ancient Western world&#x2019;s greatest thinkers and India&#x2019;s yogis, including a belief in karma and reincarnation. Today ancient Greek philosophers are remembered as the founders of Western science and civilization. We&#x2019;ve forgotten that for over a thousand years they were revered as sages, masters of spiritual wisdom. <i>Lost Masters</i> is an exploration of our long-lost Western spiritual heritage and the surprising insights it can offer us today.<br></p><p><b>Linda Johnsen</b> has a master&#x2019;s degree in Eastern studies and has done postgraduate work in the history of religions.

Focusing on the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth, Miller chronicles how southern music&#x2014;a fluid complex of sounds and styles in practice&#x2014;was reduced to a series of distinct genres linked to particular racial and ethnic identities. The blues were African American. Rural white southerners played country music. By the 1920s, these depictions were touted in folk song collections and the catalogs of &#x201c;race&#x201d; and &#x201c;hillbilly&#x201d; records produced by the phonograph industry. Such links among race, region, and music were new. Black and white artists alike had played not only blues, ballads, ragtime, and string band music, but also nationally popular sentimental ballads, minstrel songs, Tin Pan Alley tunes, and Broadway hits. <p>In a cultural history filled with musicians, listeners, scholars, and business people, Miller describes how folklore studies and the music industry helped to create a &#x201c;musical color line,&#x201d; a cultural parallel to the physical color line that came to define the Jim Crow South. Segregated sound emerged slowly through the interactions of southern and northern musicians, record companies that sought to penetrate new markets across the South and the globe, and academic folklorists who attempted to tap southern music for evidence about the history of human civilization. Contending that people&#x2019;s musical worlds were defined less by who they were than by the music that they heard, Miller challenges assumptions about the relation of race, music, and the market.</p></p><p>&#34;In this head-banging, eye-opening study, Karl Hagstrom Miller examines with stunning clarity the historical and material grounding of the music industry&#39;s three main revenue streams: live performance, recording, and publishing. Along the way, he demonstrates how the notion of authenticity in folklore discourse, systemic Jim Crow, and minstrelsy legacies worked together to calcify our contemporary--and quite naturalized--perceptions about music and racialized bodies.If you ever wondered where MTV, CMT, VH1, and BET got their marketing logic, look no further.

The crowning achievement of Peter Weiss&#x2014;the internationally renowned writer best known for his play <i>Marat/Sade</i>&#x2014;<i>The Aesthetics of Resistance</i> spans the period from the late 1930s to World War II, dramatizing antifascist resistance and the rise and fall of proletarian political parties in Europe.<br><br> Volume two, initially published in 1978, opens as the unnamed narrator finds himself in Paris after having retreated from the front lines of the Spanish Civil War. From there, he moves on to Stockholm, where he works in a factory, becomes involved with the Communist Party, and meets Bertolt Brecht. Featuring the narrator's extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature, the novel teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures. Throughout, the narrator explores the affinity between political resistance and art&#x2014;the connection at the heart of Weiss's novel.

Indeed, the United States was established by means of violence as ordinary citizens from New Hampshire to Georgia answered George Washington&#x2019;s call to arms.<br><br>Since then, war has become a staple of American history. Counting the War for Independence, the United States has fought the armed forces of other nations at least twelve times, averaging a major conflict every twenty years. In so doing, the objectives have been simple: advance the cause of freedom, protect U.S. interests, and impose America&#x2019;s will upon a troubled world. More often than not, the results have been successful as America&#x2019;s military has accounted itself well. Yet the cost has been high, in both blood and treasure. Americans have fought and died around the globe&#x2014;on land, at sea, and in the air. Without doubt, their actions have shaped the world in which we live.<br><br>In this comprehensive collection, Terence T. Finn provides a set of narratives&#x2014;each concise and readable&#x2014;on the twelve major wars America has fought. He explains what happened, and why such places as Saratoga and Antietam, Manila Bay and Midway are important to an understanding of America&#x2019;s past. Readers will easily be able to brush up on their history and acquaint themselves with those individuals and events that have helped define the United States of America.</p><p>Educated at Williams College and the University of Sussex, <b>Terence T. Finn</b> holds a PhD from Georgetown University. His career encompasses the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as well as staff positions on Capitol Hill. Finn is the author of two novels, <i>The Best of Times </i>and <i>To Begin Again</i>, as well as <i>When Europe Went Mad</i>, an account of the First World War.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;Twelve of the wars in which the United States fought are discussed here in a manner that is thorough yet concise. Finn&#x2014;When Europe Went Mad (Pentland, 2009)&#x2014;discusses the events, the reasons why the war was fought, and how the outcome was important to the United States. In order for a war to be included, it had to meet the following criteria: it was large in scale, the enemy was a sovereign state, and the outcome had to influence the future of the U.S. significantly. Though the Cold War, French and Indian War, and the Panama Incursion are not included, each of the following has a chapter dedicated to it: the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican/American War, War Between the States, Spanish/American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Afghanistan. While the technology and participants have changed throughout the years, it is clear that war is still a conflict of organized violence, the necessity of which many will disagree. A victory depends greatly on who is in charge and the available resources. Even though the trade title reads like a textbook, the pacing of Sean Pratt's narration makes it easy to understand and tolerable. Best for students looking for an in-depth picture of wars in the history of the U.S. or for those who are teaching the subject.

Through their work in the material realm, alchemists discovered personal rebirth as well as a linking between outer and inner dimensions.</p><br><p> C. G. Jung first turned to alchemy for personal illumination in coping with trauma brought on by his break with Freud. Alchemical symbolism eventually suggested to Jung that there was a <i>process</i> in the unconscious, one that had a goal beyond discharging tension and hiding pain. In this book, Nathan Schwartz-Salant, a leading Jungian analyst with an interest in alchemy, brings together a key selection of Jung's writings on the subject. These writings expose us to Jung's fascinating reflections on the symbols of alchemy--such as the three-headed Mercurial dragon, hermaphrodites, and lions devouring the sun--and brings us closer to the spirit of his approach to the unconscious, closer than his purely scientific concepts often allow.</p></p><p>Alchemical symbolism eventually suggested to Jung that there was a process in the unconscious, one that had a goal beyond discharging tension and hiding pain.

The root text gives in thirty-seven short verses the essential practices leading to enlightenment. Gyalsay Togme Sangpo (1295-1369) was renowned as a bodhisattva in Tibet and revered for living according to the bodhisattva ideals and practices that he taught. He inspired not only his direct disciples but also generations of practitioners up to the present day. This extraordinary commentary by Geshe Jampa Tegchok clearly explains the popular practice of exchanging oneself with others for developing love and compassion for all living beings. It lays open the methods for doing glance stabilizing and analytical meditations and offers an in-depth discussion of the nature of emptiness. All the essentials are here for transforming our attitudes and developing courage and joy.</p><p>Geshe Jampa Tegchok became a monk at the age of eight. He studied all of the major Buddhist treatises at Sera-je Monastery in Tibet before fleeing his homeland in 1959. After staying in the refugee camp at Buxa India Geshe Tegchok went to Varanasi where he obtained his Acharya degree and taught for seven years. He then began teaching in the West - three years in England and ten years at Nalanda Monastery in France. In 1993 His Holiness the Dalai Lama appointed him as abbot of Sera-je Monastic University in India. Retired from that position, he now teaches widely in the United States.</p><h2>Woolly Thoughts: Unlock Your Creative Genius with Modular Knitting (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)</h2><p>Here's the revolutionary way to knit&#x2014;easy, fun, and foolproof!

They have been handpicked, cultivated, and meticulously packaged in order to make you believe what they have to say&#x2014;preferably in an "objective" format like a news show or a letter to the editor.

There are two kinds of "experts" in question--the PR spin doctors behind the scenes and the "independent" experts paraded before the public, scientists who have been hand-selected, cultivated, and paid handsomely to promote the views of corporations involved in controversial actions. Lively writing on controversial topics such as dioxin, bovine growth hormone, and genetically modified food makes this a real page-turner, shocking in its portrayal of the real and potential dangers in each of these technological innovations and of the "media pseudo-environment" created to obfuscate the risks. By financing and publicizing views that support the goals of corporate sponsors, PR campaigns have, over the course of the century, managed to suppress the dangers of lead poisoning for decades, silence the scientist who discovered that rats fed on genetically modified corn had significant organ abnormalities, squelch television and newspaper stories about the risks of bovine growth hormone, and place enough confusion and doubt in the public's mind about global warming to suppress any mobilization for action. <p> Rampton and Stauber introduce the movers and shakers of the PR industry, from the "risk communicators" (whose job is to downplay all risks) and "outrage managers" (with their four strategies--deflect, defer, dismiss, or defeat) to those who specialize in "public policy intelligence" (spying on opponents). Evidently, these elaborate PR campaigns are created for our own good. According to public relations philosophers, the public reacts emotionally to topics related to health and safety and is incapable of holding rational discourse. Needless to say, Rampton and Stauber find these views rather antidemocratic and intend to pull back the curtain to reveal the real wizard in Oz. This is one wake-up call that's hard to resist. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber are the bestselling authors of <b>Weapons of Mass Deception</b>, <b>Toxic</b> <b>Sludge Is Good for You!</b>, <b>Banana Republicans</b>, and <b>Trust Us, We're Experts!</b> Stauber is the founder and director of the Center for Media &amp; Democracy.

Such jobs have all but vanished over the past forty years, and in their absence ever-growing numbers of young adults now hold precarious, low-paid jobs with few fringe benefits. Facing such insecure economic prospects, less-educated young adults are increasingly forgoing marriage and are having children within unstable cohabiting relationships. This has created a large marriage gap between them and their more affluent, college-educated peers. In Labor&#x2019;s Love Lost, noted sociologist Andrew Cherlin offers a new historical assessment of the rise and fall of working-class families in America, demonstrating how momentous social and economic transformations have contributed to the collapse of this once-stable social class and what this seismic cultural shift means for the nation&#x2019;s future. Drawing from more than a hundred years of census data, Cherlin documents how today&#x2019;s marriage gap mirrors that of the Gilded Age of the late-nineteenth century, a time of high inequality much like our own. Cherlin demonstrates that the widespread prosperity of working-class families in the mid-twentieth century, when both income inequality and the marriage gap were low, is the true outlier in the history of the American family. In fact, changes in the economy, culture, and family formation in recent decades have been so great that Cherlin suggests that the working-class family pattern has largely disappeared. Labor's Love Lost shows that the primary problem of the fall of the working-class family from its mid-twentieth century peak is not that the male-breadwinner family has declined, but that nothing stable has replaced it. The breakdown of a stable family structure has serious consequences for low-income families, particularly for children, many of whom underperform in school, thereby reducing their future employment prospects and perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of economic disadvantage. To address this disparity, Cherlin recommends policies to foster educational opportunities for children and adolescents from disadvantaged families. He also stresses the need for labor market interventions, such as subsidizing low wages through tax credits and raising the minimum wage. Labor's Love Lost provides a compelling analysis of the historical dynamics and ramifications of the growing number of young adults disconnected from steady, decent-paying jobs and from marriage. Cherlin&#x2019;s investigation of today&#x2019;s &#x201c;would-be working class&#x201d; shines a much-needed spotlight on the struggling middle of our society in today&#x2019;s new Gilded Age.</p></p><p>ANDREW J. CHERLIN is the Benjamin H. Griswold III Professor of Public Policy in the Department of Sociology at the Johns Hopkins University.<p>&#x201c;A cogent, balanced analysis of why the gap between the &#x2018;haves&#x2019; and &#x2018;have-nots&#x2019; has grown in family life as well as economic life. Culture counts in family out-comes, Cherlin explains, but its impact is filtered through income inequality and job instability in ways that can&#x2019;t be solved by a return to &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; values. A must-read for policy-makers and concerned citizens.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;STEPHANIE COONTZ</b>, Evergreen State University</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Without a doubt, Cherlin&#x2019;s account of the changing circumstance of working- class families is the most comprehensive, engaging, and convincing explanation of why and how our family system has changed in the past half century.

One of the increasingly popular trees to add into the landscape design is the Paw Paw. Not since Pogo, has there hardly been a mention of this bizarre fruit, but now there is a strong interest in large scale Paw Paw orchards. The fruit has a sweet banana custard-like taste. In the landscape design, Paw Paw makes a nice medium-sized tree for the shaded areas. This is an easy to read guide that will help with planting, fertilizing, and more information.</p><p>We hope that you found the book informative and helpful. There is a lot of informative, and it was made to be an easy-to-read, but useful for a wide range of readers and tree planting folks.Thank you for your comments about the book. Yes, it was meant to be a simple read, but about the Paw Paw. Over the years, we have had many people ask about how to actually plant Paw Paws, and we thought it was time to give the general how-to ideas about that. There is some good information about this unique tree species, with the intent to make tree planting simple and easy to understand.</p><h2>The Elixir of Love (L&#39;elisir d&#39;amore): Opera Score Editions</h2><p>(Vocal Score). Italian/English. Translated by Martin.</p><p>Text: English, French, Italian</p><h2>Quite a Year for Plums: A Novel</h2><p>Anyone who has read the best-selling <i>Mama Makes Up Her Mind</i> or listened to Bailey White's commentaries on NPR knows that she is a storyteller of inimitable wit and charm. Now, in her stunningly accomplished first novel, she introduces us to the peculiar yet lovable people who inhabit a small town in south Georgia. Meet serious, studious Roger, the peanut pathologist and unlikely love object of half the town's women. Meet Roger's ex-mother-in-law, Louise, who teams up with an ardent typographer in an attempt to attract outer-space invaders with specific combinations of letters and numbers. And meet Della, the bird artist who captivates Roger with the sensible but enigmatic notes she leaves on things she throws away at the Dumpster ("This fan works, but makes a clicking sound and will not oscillate").<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Heartbreakingly tender, often hilarious, Quite a Year for Plums is a delectable treat from a writer who has been called a national treasure.</p><p>Bailey White's intimate vignettes of small-town life are loosely held together by their subjects, who are themselves tightly held together by love, family, and idiosyncrasy. This episodic mode, which has made her a favorite on National Public Radio, suits her just as well as a novelist. In <i>Quite a Year for Plums</i>, even the temporary denizens of her fictional southern Georgia town have their oddities: a bird artist is obsessed by a vanishing breed of chickens and has nightmares about chicken feet, while another dreams night and day of typography. He compares, for instance, the Mistral font to George Hamilton and laments the bastardization of Bodoni. It is perhaps the Gill Sans typeface that most raises his aesthetic hackles: "They shorten the uppers, they enlarge the counters, they round off the angles, they make it soft and slack. They castrate it!" (Suffice it to say that his partner in lamentation is a woman who fervently believes in little spacemen of the nonhuman variety.)<p> In addition to the extraterrestrialite, the permanent townsfolk include a pair of retired schoolteachers who have been reading aloud to each other for 50 years each Thursday in May. Why Thursday? Why only May? White doesn't let us in on that secret: she's reluctant to intrude too much on her characters' habits and hobby horses, even though they are happy enough to intrude on one another. What concerns these eccentrics above all is plant pathologist and banjo picker Roger Meadows, whom men and women alike admire. "Perhaps because of his years of walking in densely planted fields of tobacco and peanuts," White describes him at one social event, "Roger had a graceful way of moving through a crowd, gently slipping between the people as if they were sticky, floppy leaves that he must not bruise." A photo of him comparing sick and healthy peanut plants is the closest thing the place has to a pin-up. Even his ex-wife's aunt has one on her refrigerator: "On the white of Roger's shirt Eula printed R-O-G-E-R in proud capital letters, with the final R dipping down out of consideration for the roots of the healthy peanut plant." </p><p> Above all, his peers would like Roger to settle down with the right woman, in the wake of his failed marriage to the town's <i>belle dame sans merci</i>. Alas, when he falls under the spell of an inappropriate candidate--the aforementioned bird artist--they seem to know it won't last. But White describes this unusual romance with such sweetness and generosity that the reader hopes differently. <i>Quite a Year for Plums</i> is filled with strange social convergences, quiet comedy, and understated tragedy. The author has an eye--and, of course, ear--for the telling detail and the decisive, domestic moment.</p>"White will transport readers to that place where the language is languid, the bees hum . . . and everybody-- in a nice kind of way--is a little off-kilter." --San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"An enchanting work, as delicately stitched as a spider web." --The Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br>"A novel of many perspectives. . . . On one level, Quite a Year for Plums is about chickens and peanut cultivars and pine- straw fires; on another, it's about art and impermanence and freedom." --The New York Times Book Review <br><br>"Deliciously funny. . . .

By highlighting the primary power sources involved in the performance of the sport it enables coaches and archers alike to understand and perfect their skills in ways that use the natural movements of archer and bow in co-ordination.<br>Previous books have emphasised, quite rightly, the importance of the right mental approach to the sport - concentration, determination, motivation and visualisation. However, mental powers on their own are not enough to guarantee a good performance. Archery is a natural psychophysical motor skill that depends on efficient use of bones, joints, muscles and tendons. <b>Archery Anatomy</b> combines clear, accurate drawings and diagrams with explanatory text to provide a primer on the subject that is accessible even to those with no technological bias.<br>The book is not tied to any specific national or international rules; it can be used by archers throughout the world to gain an understanding of the bio-mechanics of the sport. Originating from the author's awareness that the basic problems of most archers stemmed from their ignorance of these aspects, it should make an invaluable contribution to the overall improvement of performance standards.<br><br>Despite the important interrelationship in archery between the anatomy of the human body and the anatomy of the bow, no book on the subject has previously been published. ARCHERY ANATOMY will therefore be an important and unique primer for coaches and performers alike. Detailed drawings combined with explanatory text explain how the skeleton and muscles should be used to improve performance in the most natural way, without artificial or strained movements. The book will stimulate analysis and understanding of the sport and, since it is not tied to any national or international rules, it will be useful to archers throughout the world, regardless of what discipline is practised. Coming at a time when sports science is becoming an essential qualification for all coaches, it is likely to be recognised as the standard work on the subject.</p><p><b>Ray Axford</b> has been active in archery for 20 years.

Thirty city blocks were burned to the ground, perhaps 150 died, and the prosperous black community of Greenwood, Oklahoma, was turned to rubble.<br><br>Brophy draws on his own extensive research into contemporary accounts and court documents to chronicle this devastating riot, showing how and why the rule of law quickly eroded. Brophy shines his lights on mob violence and racism run amok, both on the night of the riot and the following morning. Equally important, he shows how the city government and police not only permitted looting, shootings, and the burning of Greenwood, but actively participated in it by deputizing white citizens haphazardly, giving out guns and badges, or sending men to arm themselves. Likewise, the National Guard acted unconstitutionally, arresting every black resident they found, leaving property vulnerable to the white mob.<br><br>Brophy's stark narrative concludes with a discussion of reparations for victims of the riot through lawsuits and legislative action. That case has implications for other reparations movements, including reparations for slavery.<br>"Recovers a largely forgotten history of black activism in one of the grimmest periods of race relations....

Linking history with advocacy, Brophy also offers a reasoned defense of reparations for the riot's victims."--<em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"At once meticulously factual and riveting, Alfred Brophy's moving account of a 1921 race riot that destroyed an economically self-reliant, vibrant African-American community clarifies why political action and enforcement of legal and human rights are indispensable perquisites for black economic opportunity and material progress. Brophy also clarifies why Americans need to find the courage to acknowledge injustices of the recent past and contrive amends to help heal still-unresolved consequences scarring both victims and perpetrators."--Jane Jacobs<p></p><br>"Timely, well documented and powerfully written...vividly illustrates a chapter of America's sordid racist past by focusing on the Tulsa Race Riots of 1921. If we are to transcend the barriers to racial progress, we all must read Brophy's compelling work and use it as a seminal case in our path to avoid conflicts at all costs.... Brophy's book is the best-written account of the Tulsa riots, and captures the people of Tulsa's resolve to never allow a similar travesty to occur again. Every person interested in racial justice should have this book at his or her disposal."--Charles J.

Insight into the interpretation of landscapes is developed from basic principles and simple models, and by stepping through the equations that capture the essence of the mechanics and chemistry of landscapes. Boxed worked examples and real-world applications bring the subject to life for students, allowing them to apply the theory to their own experience. The book covers cutting edge topics, including the revolutionary cosmogenic nuclide dating methods and modeling, highlights links to other Earth sciences through up-to-date summaries of current research, and illustrates the importance of geomorphology in understanding environmental changes. Setting up problems as a conservation of mass, ice, soil, or heat, this book arms students with tools to fully explore processes, understand landscapes, and to participate in this rapidly evolving field.</p><p>This textbook provides a modern, quantitative and process-oriented approach to equip students with the tools to understand geomorphology.

The aim of the book is to give readers who might not normally choose to engage with mathematics recreationally the chance to discover some interesting mathematical ideas from within a familiar context, and to see the applicability of mathematics to real-world situations. Through this process, readers should improve their critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as broaden their views of what mathematics really is and how it can be used in unexpected ways. The book was written specifically for non-mathematical audiences and requires virtually no mathematical prerequisites beyond basic arithmetic. At the same time, the questions included are designed to challenge both mathematical and non-mathematical audiences alike. More than giving the right answers, this book asks the right questions. The book is fun to read, with examples that are not just thought-provoking, but also entertaining. It is written in a style that is casual without being condescending. But the discovery-based approach of the book also forces readers to play an active role in their learning, which should lead to a sense of ownership of the main ideas in the book. And while the book provides answers to some of the important questions in the field of mathematical voting theory, it also leads readers to discover new questions and ways to approach them. In addition to making small improvements in all the chapters, this second edition contains several new chapters. Of particular interest might be Chapter 12 which covers a host of topics related to gerrymandering.</p><p>Jonathan K. Hodge: Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI, Richard E. Klima: Appalachian State University, Boone, NCThe authors should be commended for writing an interesting, historically motivated, mathematically rigorous text that is accessible to a non-mathematical audience...Even though the book is written to be used in an inquiry-based course, the clarity and accessibility of the writing mean that it could still be used as a main reference text in courses that are run in a different fashion...The narrative flow of this material is excellent. --David McCune, Mathematical Reviews</p><h2>Words &amp; Ideas</h2><p><p>Unlike most etymology textbooks, this one presents the words studied in the context of the ideas in which the words functioned.

Dominik has created an introductory Classics curriculum within the context of a vocabulary builder and beginning etymology textbook. Not only is <i>Words and Ideas</i> multipurpose in scope, but it is also suitable for a variety of learning situations, from autodidacts yes, you can sit down on your own with <i>Words and Ideas</i> to homeschooling parents to regular high school or college teachers.<p>Supplementing each chapter of Dominik's <i>Words and Ideas</i>, are bibliographies, exercises, websites, and invaluable Word for Word cartoon strips. <i>Words and Ideas</i> can be read in almost any order or, if it's for personal interest, even randomly, but structured approaches would work better in the classroom. For this reason, Dominik suggests two structured approaches: either to focus first on the first three chapters to build up some basic understanding of word building before proceeding to the Greek and Roman culture and further word building sections or to study the first three chapters in conjunction with the remaining nine cultural chapters.</p><p>The first three chapters of <i>Words and Ideas</i> introduce word building, with essential, basic, explained terms like base, prefix, and suffix. Dominik explains the creation of hybrid words like sociology, which comes from a Latin base and a Greek ending, and the twisted paths by which Latin and Greek words find their way into our English vocabulary. Dominik says about sixty percent of words in common use in English are derived from Latin.... Dominik's writing style in this potentially confusing area is clear and precise.</p><p>Starting with Chapter 4, Dominik focused on Greco-Roman culture, the differences between Greece and Rome, and the essential words used to describe first mythology, then medicine, politics and law, commerce and economics, philosophy and psychology, and history. In the process, Dominik summarizes:<br> -the creation stories and major myths of the Greek gods and heroes<br> - the change from magic to reason-based medicine<br> -the development of the ancient city, democracy and the effect of Roman law on American and South African law<br> -financial systems and trade, including slavery and ancient machinery<br> -the concept of knowledge, with a quick look at individual pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, the Stoic, Epicurean and Cynic philosophers, with a Freudian excursis, and finally<br> - the contributions made by historians to our knowledge of times past with a look at and occasional passage written by the ancient philosophers Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Josephus, Caesar, Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus.</p><p>Cartoons drive points home quickly and provide easily remembered anecdotes about etymology. Did you know the tree-filled area we know of as an arbor does not come from the Latin word for tree? The (translated into English) literary passages are short. Dominik makes ample use of tables, lists, and bullet points, with occasional illustrations. These techniques make <i>Words and Ideas</i> easy and appealing to use. To keep <i>Words and Ideas</i> short, there is no answer key. This should not be a problem if the student (and homeschooling or other teacher) reads the chapter carefully and keeps a dictionary with etymologies handy.</p><p><i>Words and Ideas</i> may look confusing and not at all like your vision of a word builder, but if you dig through the wealth of clearly presented material and challenging exercises, I think you will agree that you have found a gem. --N. S. Gill, About.com<br><br>....Dominik's stated aim is to broaden the vocabulary and cultural literacy of students within the context of Classics and other disciplines. The first three chapters explain the basics of word building: he shows how specific nouns, verbs, and adjectives relate to each other and how words can be broken down into the base, prefix, and suffix. The subsequent chapters contain overviews of classical mythology, law, medicine, history, commerce, philosophy, and psychology each followed by tables of Enligh/American words relevant to that particular topic, all with their classical derivations. The arrangement of words into their subject disciplines is why the book is different from other etymological handbooks though there is an alphabetical index if you need it. As an example, the medicine chapter will explain the difference between optometrist, optician, oculist, and ophthalmologist, and the precise meanings of antimelanin and epinephrine. Latin - and Greek- less medical students might find an intensive weekend on this chapter a useful shortcut to medicalese.</p><p>The book is attractive, compact, and contains useful extras: bibliographies, related web-sites, lists of Latin/Greek phrases and reasonably amusing cartoons which serve to break up the text. Dominik suggests using the first three chapters as a course book and there are exercises at the end of all the chapters. --Sue Pontin, JACT</p></p><h2>My Google Chromebook</h2><p><b>Step-by-step</b> <br>instructions with callouts to Google Chromebook photos that show you exactly what to do <br> <b>Help</b> <br>when you run into Chromebook problems or limitations <br> <b>Tips and Notes</b> <br>to help you get the most from your Chromebook <br> <b>Full-color, step-by-step tasks walk you through doing exactly what you want with your Chromebook.</b> &nbsp; Learn how to <ul> <li> Set up and configure your new Chromebook </li> <li> Personalize your Chromebook&#x2019;s desktop and other settings </li> <li> Use your Chromebook with the touchpad, keyboard, or touchscreen </li> <li> Browse and search the Web with the Google Chrome browser </li> <li> Manage your files wherever they&#x2019;re stored: on your Chromebook, on an external drive, or in the cloud </li> <li> Find great new Chrome and Android apps in the Google Play Store </li> <li> Strengthen privacy with Incognito Mode and Google&#x2019;s privacy settings </li> <li> Watch streaming TV shows and movies with Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video </li> <li> Listen to streaming music with Pandora, Spotify, and Google Play Music </li> <li> View and fix photos with Google Photos </li> <li> Print from anywhere with Google Cloud Print </li> <li> Send, receive, read, and manage email through Google Gmail </li> <li> Get productive with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides </li> <li> Use your Google Chromebook for education </li> <li> Optimize Chromebook performance and battery life </li> <li> Troubleshoot and recover from problems </li> </ul></p><p><p> <b>Michael Miller</b> is a prolific and popular writer of more than 200 nonfiction books, known for his ability to explain complex topics to everyday readers.

Accompanied by an abundance of clearly explained examples, the Global English guidelines show you how to write documentation that is optimized for non-native speakers of English, translators, and even machine-translation software, as well as for native speakers of English. You&#39;ll find dozens of guidelines that you won&#39;t find in any other source, along with thorough explanations of why each guideline is useful. The author also includes revision strategies, as well as caveats that will help you avoid applying guidelines incorrectly. Focusing primarily on sentence-level stylistic issues, problematic grammatical constructions, and terminology issues, this book addresses the following topics: ways to simplify your writing style and make it consistent; ambiguities that most writers and editors are not aware of, and how to eliminate those ambiguities; how to make your sentence structure more explicit so that your sentences are easier for native and non-native speakers to read and understand; punctuation and capitalization guidelines that improve readability and make translation more efficient; and how language technologies such as controlled-authoring software can facilitate the adoption of Global English as a corporate standard. This text is intended for anyone who uses written English to communicate technical information to a global audience. Technical writers, technical editors, science writers, and training instructors are just a few of the professions for which this book is essential reading. Even if producing technical information is not your primary job function, the Global English guidelines can help you communicate more effectively with colleagues around the world.</p><p>John R.

Ram Charan, expert in corporate governance and best-selling author, packs this book with useful tools and techniques to take boards and their companies to a higher level of performance. Charan puts his finger on a growing problem for boards: the disconnect between directors' efforts and their results. The added time and attention boards invest is not translating into better governance�??that is, governance that adds value to the business. <p><b>Boards That Deliver</b> gets beyond the rhetoric of corporate governance reform. It captures the tried-and-true practices used by high-performance boards. In contrast to experts who base prescriptions on number-crunching exercises, Charan identifies the real problems that drain directors' time and suppress their best judgments�??and explains clearly and succinctly how boards can solve those problems. These battle-tested solutions help boards achieve what rules and regulations alone cannot�??to get succession right, refine a winning strategy, and design a rational CEO compensation package.</p> <p>Good governance requires leadership. <b>Boards That Deliver</b> is the no-nonsense guide for directors and CEOs who are rising to the leadership challenge to make their boards a competitive advantage.</p></p><p>A Road Map for Meeting the Challenge of the New Corporate Environment <p>"Boards today are striving to improve in a very dynamic environment.

This book addresses two of the most challenging problems facing contemporary neurobiology and cognitive science: first, understanding how we unconsciously execute habitual actions as a result of neurological and cognitive processes that are not formal actions of conscious judgment but part of a habitual nexus of systematic self-organization; second, creating an ethics adequate to our present awareness that there is no such thing as a transcendental self, a stable subject, or a soul.</p> <p>In earlier modes of cognitive science, cognition was conceptualized according to a model of representation and abstract reasoning. In the realm of ethics, this corresponded to the philosophical tenet that to do what is ethical is to do what corresponds to an abstract set of rules. By contrast to this computationalism, the author places central emphasis on what he terms "enaction"&#x2015;cognition as the ability to negotiate embodied, everyday living in a world that is inseparable from our sensory-motor capacities.</p> <p>Apart from his researches in cognitive science, the bodies of thought that enable Varela to make this link are phenomenology and two representatives of what he calls the "wisdom traditions": Confucian ethics and Buddhist epistemology. From the Confucian tradition, he draws upon the <i>Mencius</i> to propose an ethics of praxis, one in which ethical action is conceived as a project of being rather than as a system of judgment, less a matter of rules that are universally applicable than a goal of expertise, sagehood.</p> <p>The Buddhist contribution to his project encompasses "the embodiment of the void" and the "pragmatics of a virtual self." How does a belief system that does not posit a unitary self or subject conceive the living of an "I"? In summation, the author proposes an ethics founded on "savoir faire" that is a practice of transformation based on a constant recognition of the "virtual" nature of ourselves in the actual operations of our mental lives.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Varela&#x2019;s work, in general, and this book, in particular, offer many enduring and insightful perspectives to scholars in the field of education and the complexiity sciences.&#x201d;&#x2014;Complicitiy: An International Journal of Complexity and EducationFrancisco J.

Delving beyond the Capone mythology. Bergreen finds a paradox: a coldblooded killer, thief, pimp, and racketeer who was also a devoted son and father; a self-styled Robin Hood who rose to the top of organized crime. Capone is a masterful portrait of an extraordinary time and of the one man who reigned supreme over it all, Al Capone.</p><p>Laurence Bergreen is an award-winning biographer and historian. His books have been translated into twenty-five languages worldwide. Among his books are biographies of Christopher Columbus, Giacomo Casanova, Marco Polo, Ferdinand Magellan, Louis Armstrong, Al Capone, and Irving Berlin. He lives in New York City.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b><i>Campanilismo</i></b><br><br>He was atavistic, flamboyant, impossible to ignore. A big fat man with a cigar and a $50,000 pinkie ring. A jowly smiling Satan nearly six feet tall, with two scars across his left cheek. He weighed over two-fifty, yet despite his bulk and the sloppy grin, he could move with lethal speed and force. Not an articulate man, he was nonetheless charismatic: warm, charming, generous. A big tipper. He attempted elegance with an outrageous wardrobe -- custom-tailored suits of purple, electric blue, or yellow; pearl-gray fedoras accented by a black band; and diamond-encrusted stickpins. He liked people, wanted them to adore him, and people gravitated toward him, they applauded him, sought his autograph, and as he excused himself as a businessman or a rogue, he submitted to their hero worship and condemnation.<br><br>His name was Al Capone, and he was, according to the <i>New York Times</i> on the occasion of his death, January 25, 1947, "the symbol of a shameful era, the monstrous symptom of a disease which was eating into the conscience of America. Looking back on it now, this period of Prohibition in full, ugly flower seems fantastically incredible. Capone himself was incredible, the creation of an evil dream."<br><br>Incredible. Fantastic. Ugly. Evil. In harsh, censorious language the obituaries attempted to explain, condemn, and, perversely, revel in his life and career. They informed the public that "Alfonso Caponi" had been born in Naples in 1895, as if no American lad could ever grow up to be so evil. They evoked his apprenticeship to crime in Manhattan's Little Italy, in particular, a neighborhood known as the Mulberry Street Bend; reproduced his draft card; mentioned his service during the Great War as part of the French "Lost Battalion" and described the duel -- though some accounts referred to shrapnel -- which gave him the two famous scars across his left cheek. They confided that his nickname was "Scarface"; explained that the young Capone fled a murder rap in New York and arrived in Chicago one step ahead of the police to work for his cousin Johnny Torrio, vice lord of that city. They portrayed him as the mastermind behind the notorious St. Valentine's Day Massacre on February 14, 1929; in some accounts he even wielded a machine gun himself. They gave as the cause of his death pneumonia or a stroke, or a combination of the two; and, finally, they unanimously claimed his death marked the end of an era of gangsters and murder in Chicago and around the country. Thus his life became a paradigm of the gangster's progress in America.<br><br>However, nearly all of this endlessly repeated -- and generally accepted -- information was erroneous, beginning with the time and place of his birth. So, too, was the story of his military service in the Great War; the often-reproduced draft card actually belonged to another Al Capone, a butcher who resided in New Jersey. The manner in which he received his scar was similarly falsified and romanticized, as was his real nickname ("Scarface" was strictly for the movies and newspapers), the true cause of his death, even the correct spelling of his name. Nor did his demise mark the end of gang-land, as his moralizing obituaries predicted; powerful racketeers followed Capone as surely as they had preceded him. "You who only know him from newspaper stories will never realize the real man he is," his younger sister, Mafalda, publicly stated, but her words fell on deaf ears or met with outright derision; was she not blinded by family loyalty? And then there were the movies and later the television programs inspired by his career, which served to increase the confusion surrounding his deeds and reputation, since these dramatizations endowed characters engaged in largely fictional exploits with the names of real people. Ultimately, the Al Capone who became familiar to Americans is a myth: a poisonous but intoxicating blend of the shrill yellow journalism of the 1920s, Hollywood sensationalism, and pervasive anti-Italian prejudice. These multiple distortions transformed Capone into a larger-than-life symbol of evil.<br><br>For decades American politicians and writers had been warning the populace about Al Capone -- or someone very much like him -- as an example of the alien element contaminating clean native shores with disease, throwing the nation's economy into turmoil with cheap labor, and corrupting Anglo-American institutions with rapacious feudal codes. The Capone phenomenon, according to such voices, was the natural and inevitable outcome of the nation's permitting millions of immigrants from around the world to flow into the country during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Among the most influential critics of unrestricted immigration was a Republican member of Congress from Massachusetts, the Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge. The scion of a wealthy family, a historian, and a former editor of the respected <i>North American Review,</i> Lodge personified the political, economic, and financial establishments of his day; well could he presume to decide whom to admit to the United States and whom to exclude. In 1891, three years before Capone's parents arrived in New York, this flower of New England warned that during the previous fifteen years alone, almost 6.5 million immigrants had poured into the country, a number "equal to one-tenth of the entire population of the country," a sum, he warned, that contained "enough voters to decide a presidential election." Lodge wanted them to stay away for precisely the reasons they wished to come, because they were impoverished, uneducated, without a secure place in the world. "We have the right to exclude illiterate persons from our immigration," he insisted, and he proposed screening the millions of undesirables washing up on American shores with a literacy test, a notoriously elastic gauge. "And this test," he concluded, "combined with others of a more general character, would in all probability shake out a large part of the undesirable portion of the present immigration. It would reduce in a discriminating manner the number of immigrants, and would thereby benefit the labor market." Later in the year, Lodge warned that the United States had become a haven for the "paupers and criminals" of Europe. "It is certainly madness to permit this stream to pour in without discrimination or selection, or the exclusion of dangerous and undesirable elements," by which he meant, specifically, Italians, who, he noted, simply came to this country to earn money and then returned home to spend it, enriching their countrymen at the expense of Americans. Despite Lodge's warning and an 1882 federal law excluding paupers and criminals, immigration continued almost unchecked, inhibited only by the Great War. "We are overwhelmed, submerged and almost drowned out by great flood-tide of European riff-raff, the refuse of almost every nation on the continent, paupers, criminals, beggars and the muddy residuum of foreign civilizations," complained the <i>New York Herald.</i> "We don't wonder that they want to come to this country, but the country is not a philanthropic institution or an asylum for the crippled and depraved of the globe....The sooner we take a decided stand and shut down the gates the better." Not until 1924 did Congress finally establish a quota system for immigrants.<br><br>Each immigrant group suffered from this intense bias in its own way, but one of the cruelest stereotypes to gain currency -- and beyond that, intellectual respectability -- was that of Southern Italians like the Capones, who were invariably portrayed as lazy, lusty, stupid, and criminal. Writing in the <i>Century Magazine</i> as late as 1914, Edward Alsworth Ross, a prominent sociologist, gave voice to the beliefs of America's ruling class concerning the disreputable new arrivals, especially those who came, like Al Capone's parents, from Naples. "Steerage passengers from Naples," Ross observed, "show a distressing frequency of low foreheads, open mouths, weak chins, poor features, skew faces, small or knobby crania, and backless heads. Such people lack the power to take rational care of themselves; hence their death-rate in New York is twice the general death-rate." Too unintelligent to survive, or so Ross believed, Southern Italians also displayed a want of"mechanical aptitude." In addition, "their emotional instability stands out in sharpest contrast to the self-control of the Hebrew and the stolidity of the Slav." As for their children, their exasperated American teachers agreed that they "hate study, make slow progress, and quit school at the first opportunity....They are very weak in abstract mathematics." Coming to the New World only worsened these problems, Ross believed. They were far better off in their own country, among their own kind, he insisted. "Who can forget the joyous, shameless gregariousness of Naples?" Ross asked, where "the streets are lively with chatter and stir and folks sitting out in front and calling one another." They like it there in the slums of Naples, he supposed, where the illiterate peasants "covet the intimacies of the tenement-house." (Even that observation, intended as a compliment, held sinister implications.) In contrast to the typical Southern Italian, Ross described those national character traits he admired: "The man who 'sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not' is likely to be a German..., an Englishman with his ideal of <i>truth,</i> or an American with his ideal of <i>squareness."</i><br><br>Even the champions of the impoverished immigrants despaired at the inability of Italian arrivals to improve themselves, find employment, become educated, in short, to <i>assimilate.</i> Among the most influential was Jacob Riis, himself an immigrant who had abandoned a comfortable background in Denmark to venture to the United States. In his career as a crusading journalist with the <i>New York Evening Sun</i> and a social reformer, he displayed righteous anger at the disgraceful living conditions imposed on the newest Americans, especially children, but when he came to Italians, he portrayed them not as casualties of the appalling social conditions afflicting all immigrants, but as victims of their own flawed natures. Unlike Lodge, whose xenophobia was largely an intellectual proposition, Riis based his impressions of Italian immigrants on direct personal observation. In his otherwise progressive book, <i>How the Other Half Lives</i> (1890), Riis wrote that the Italian who comes to New York "promptly reproduces conditions of destitution and disorder which, set in the framework of Mediterran exuberance, are the delight of the artist, but in a matter-of-fact American community become its danger and reproach....The Italian comes in at the bottom...and stays there."<br><br>The harsh view shared by respected politicians and journalists had as its street equivalent a single word summing up what so many Americans thought of Italians: dago. A corruption of <i>Diego</i> (Spanish for James), the derisive epithet originated in the American West and worked its way back East, where it extended to the new Italian arrivals, who were often pitifully unaware of the climate of hatred and resentment awaiting them in America.<br><br>As Southern Italians, they had been accustomed to prejudice from the Northern provinces of their own country; indeed Northern Italians could be just as contemptuous of their Southern compatriots as Henry Cabot Lodge and Jacob Riis were. For Northerners, Italy consisted of two countries, the North and the South, or perhaps even three: the North, the South, and Sicily -- the latter province being so alien, backward, corrupt, and feudal that the Northerners referred to the Sicilians as Africans, a term that had little to do with the Sicilians' appearance but much to do with fears about their character. (As an adult trying to survive in the fiercely contested rackets, Capone came to share the non-Sicilians' fear of the "Black Italians" who dominated the business; "those crazy Sicilians" became his common complaint.) In addition to the virulent prejudice they faced at home, Southern Italians were also plagued by natural disasters; there were earthquakes, there were droughts, there were even volcanic eruptions -- all of which suggested that farmers and other peasants who made their living from the land had best flee for their lives. As a result, they kept on coming despite the extreme hostility they faced in America, and their numbers shot past the levels that had so concerned Henry Cabot Lodge. In 1880, approximately 12,300 Italians came to the United States; only eight years later, the number reached over 51,000, more than a fourfold increase. During the 1890s, Italian immigration averaged about 50,000 souls a year; and in the following decade, the first of the new century, the numbers exploded: 100,000 in 1900, 230,000 in 1903, 286,000 in 1907. The figures remained at these tremendous levels until the Great War impeded civilian transatlantic travel. Nothing -- not the threat of war between the United States and Italy or the hovels awaiting them in "Little Italys" around the nation -- deterred the Italians from coming to a land bristling with transplanted historical hatred for them. Their willingness to brave these hardships was testament to their desperation, their courage, their na�vet�, and their great hopes for life in America -- hopes that, more often than not, were to lead to conflict and bitter disappointment.<br><br>The youth of Al Capone, as with many other sons and daughters of Italian immigrants, was largely a response to this climate of anti-Italian prejudice. He and his brothers would all devise different responses; some of the strategies would prove more admirable than others, but none of them would escape it.<br><br>Al Capone always insisted he was an American, born and bred, and so he was, but his Italian heritage formed and informed every aspect of his life and career. He belonged both to the Old World -- with its fatalism, corruption of flesh and spirit, and charm -- and to the New -- with its striving, materialism, and violence.<br><br>His mother, a seamstress named Teresina Raiola, and his father, a barber named Gabriele Capone, grew to maturity, married, and started their family in Naples. Italy's third-largest city, located on the western coast approximately halfway between Rome and the boot's toe, Naples sprawls down to the ocean like a brightly colored, tattered and soiled dishrag. Neapolitans are renowned for their ability to improvise and adapt; they have to, living in a city hemmed in by Mount Vesuvius on one side and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the other, a capital that had been changing hands for over two thousand years. At one time or another, Greeks, Romans, Austrians, Spaniards, and the French (in the person of Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother) ruled the city; for a time during the eighteenth century, it had served as the seat of an improvised nation, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. As a result of this ceaseless upheaval, the city had the air of an abandoned capital that had fallen into chaos; where kings once walked, herds of sheep later grazed. "There is nothing...quite like Naples in its sordid and yet tremendous vitality," wrote Edward Hutton, an English visitor, of the city in 1915. The noise, dirt, and overcrowding appalled the fastidious Hutton; Naples seemed more "a pen of animals than a city of men, a place amazing if you will, but disgusting in its amazement, whose life is...without dignity, beauty or reticence."<br><br>However, Neapolitans enjoyed a reputation for being singularly accepting and relaxed in the midst of the dirt and chaos of their city. They had seen too much of history's folly to heed the Catholic Church; resentful of the North, or at least mindful of the North's resentment of them, Neapolitans te...</p><h2>Honda Enthusiasts Guide: Motorcycles 1959-1985</h2><p><i>Honda Motorcycles 1959 to 1985: Enthusiasts Guide</i> is designed to aid the non-professional motorcycle collector decide whether or not to buy and restore Honda motorcycles produced between 1959 and 1985. <p>For each of these models, author Doug Mitchel provides four to six paragraphs describing the bike in general terms including difference and similarities between the model being discussed and other similar models.

Boyle Stories</h2><p><b>Gathered into one volume, the first four short story collections of T.C. Boyle, winner of the 2015 Rea Award for the Short Story<br><br>T. C. Boyle</b> is one of the most inventive and wickedly funny short story writers at work today. Over the course of twenty-five years, Boyle has built up a body of short fiction that is remarkable in its range, richness, and exuberance. His stories have won accolades for their irony and black humor, for their verbal pyrotechnics, for their fascination with everything bizarre and queasy, and for the razor-sharp way in which they dissect America's obsession with image and materialism. Gathered together here are all of the stories that have appeared in his four previous collections, as well as seven that have never before appeared in book form. Together they comprise a book of small treasures, a definitive gift for Boyle fans and for every reader ready to discover the "ferocious, delicious imagination" (<b>Los Angeles Times Book Review</b>) of a "vibrant sensibility fully engaged with American society" (<b>The New York Times</b>).</p><p>Skinny, earringed, satanically goateed, T. Coraghessan Boyle is the trickster figure of American letters. Part court jester, part holy fool, he slips in and out of various narrative disguises as it suits him. Nowhere is this more evident than in his short fiction, in which he bounces from psychological naturalism to giddy slapstick, dreamy surrealism to biting satire--sometimes within the space of a single tale. The sprawling and idiosyncratic <i>T.C. Boyle Stories</i> brings together his four previous volumes of short fiction, <i>Descent of Man</i> (1979), <i>Greasy Lake</i> (1985), <i>If the River Was Whiskey</i> (1989), and <i>Without a Hero</i> (1994), as well as seven previously uncollected stories, two of which have never before seen print. In both range and sheer heft, it's a remarkable collection, the more so since it represents an artist only midway through his career.<p> These stories find Boyle partying like it's 1999. He zeroes in on our age's most uncomfortable obsessions, its late-capitalist fetishes and millenarian fears: nervous Los Angelenos suckered into buying a Montana survivalist's retreat ("On for the Long Haul"); a hygienically obsessed girlfriend who insists on wearing a full-body condom ("Modern Love"); a rich, guilty couple suffocating under the weight of a lifetime's possessions ("Filthy with Things"). Elsewhere, he updates Gogol for late Soviet times ("The Overcoat II"), retells the death of blues god Robert Johnson ("Hellhound on My Trail"), even goes clubbing with that hot '90s property, the author of <i>Mansfield Park</i> ("I Dated Jane Austen"). Boyle's comic range is unparalleled, his timing razor-sharp as he skewers everyone from burglar alarm salesmen to the Beats. Like all tricksters, the author uses our own vanity and hypocrisy against us--but with barbs as witty as those found in <i>T.C.

Some claim it promotes violence, glorifies suffering and death, and amounts to divine child abuse. Others argue it plays a pivotal role in classical Christian doctrine. Here world-renowned New Testament scholar Simon Gathercole offers an exegetical and historical defense of the traditional substitutionary view of the atonement. He provides critical analyses of various interpretations of the atonement and places New Testament teaching in its Old Testament and Greco-Roman contexts, demonstrating that the interpretation of atonement in the Pauline corpus must include substitution.</p><p><i>Defending Substitution</i> is part of the Acadia Studies in Bible and Theology series. Series editors are Craig A. Evans and Lee Martin McDonald.<br><br>"The meaning of Jesus's death remains controversial. In this short exploratory study Simon Gathercole draws on a range of classical as well as biblical sources to argue that for Paul, at least, the notion of substitution remained central. Many questions remain, but this book will give new energy to the ongoing discussion."<br>--<b>N. T. Wright</b>, University of St. Andrews<br><br>"Why is Good Friday good? According to one classic answer to this question, Jesus's shameful and violent death belongs to the good news of the gospel because he died <i>in our place</i>. By careful and lucid analysis of key passages, Simon Gathercole shows that this view has deep roots both in Paul's texts and in his Jewish and Greco-Roman cultural heritage. Often criticized and caricatured, the concept of substitution is integral to the New Testament's conviction that Christ died 'for us' and 'for our sins.'"<br>--<b>Francis Watson</b>, Durham University<br><br>"In this little book, Simon Gathercole carefully and convincingly dismisses false dichotomies. The death of Christ is presented in the Bible as both representative <i>and</i> substitutionary. These learned and lucid lectures use the prism of modern disputes to take us to the heart of Pauline teaching on the cross. I highly commend it."<br>--<b>Mark Dever</b>, pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DC<br><br>"Can Christ's work of atonement be <i>substitutionary</i> in nature? Though Reformation Protestantism has replied in the affirmative, much recent scholarship has tended to have a negative view of this atonement motif. Simon Gathercole is to be congratulated for intervening in this debate with a short, clear, and lively book that argues the case for a substitutionary motif from a biblical perspective, and with an eye to both the Christian tradition and recent debates in the literature. This is a work all those interested in the atonement will want to read and engage. It is certainly a book I shall be recommending to my students."<br>--<b>Oliver D.

Through a time-honored process, soybeans and grains are transformed into thiswondrous food, which is both a flavorful addition to a variety of dishes and a powerful medicinal. Scientific research has supported miso&#x2019;s use as an effective therapeutic aid in the prevention and treatment of a range of disorders. Part One of this guide begins with miso basics&#x2015;its types and uses. A chapter called &#x201c;Miso Medicine&#x201d; then details this superfood&#x2019;s healing properties and role&nbsp;in maintaining good health. Easy directions for making miso at home are also found in Part One. Then Part Two presents over 140 healthy recipes in which miso is used in dips, spreads, soups, and much more. Whether you are in search of healthful foods or you simply want a delicious new take on old favorites, <strong><i>The Miso Book </i></strong>may be just what the doctor ordered.</p></p><p><i> </i><p><i>John and Jan Belleme </i>are the country&#x2019;s leading authorities on miso and other traditional Japanese foods. After living in Japan, where they learned the craft of miso-making firsthand,</p> <p>the Bellemes co-founded the American Miso Company. Their extensive research on Japanese foods has resulted in four books and over a hundred articles. Currently, the Bellemes are involved with A Taste of Health, a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of natural foods through education. </p><p>The world&#x2019;s most ancient cultivated plants were not grains and vegetables but rather microscopic organisms&#x2015;molds, yeast, and bacteria&#x2015;that cause foods to ferment. Our ancestors stumbled upon the fermentation process, probably quite by accident, when they discovered that adding the right amount of salt to food prevented it from spoiling. The salt also transformed the molecular structure of the food, making it more flavorful and digestible. Through the magic of fermentation, we have learned to harness the microbial world to do our &#x201c;fireless cooking,&#x201d; transforming such foods as cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, and milk into yogurt and cheeses. In Japan, through a centuries-old double-fermentation process, soybeans and grains are transformed into miso&#x2015;one of the country&#x2019;s most revered culinary treasures.</p> <p>For the Japanese, miso preparation is considered an art form, and those who prepare it are considered Masters. As a food, miso is used to flavor and enhance the nutritional value of a wide variety of savory and satisfying dishes. As a folk remedy, it has been successfully used to treat digestive problems, cancer, radiation sickness, tobacco poisoning, and even low libido&#x2015;to the point that its healing properties have been confirmed by modern science. With varieties that offer an incredible diversity of colors, tastes, and textures, miso is no longer a secret of Eastern cuisine. This Japanese fermented food is slowly expanding its reach, stimulating the creativity of cooks around the world.</p> <p>Japan is a densely populated island with scant natural resources. During preindustrial times, the very survival of the Japanese people may well have depended on the development of their unique and diversified fermentation processes. In fact, Japan&#x2019;s two most important foods, rice and soybeans, have been preserved for centuries through the miso-making process. Before the advent of refrigeration and food pre�servatives, miso was the country&#x2019;s emergency ration of choice, and every family had a keg stored away for hard times. Indeed, with its essential vitamins and minerals and excellent balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, miso is one of nature&#x2019;s perfect survival foods. Properly stored, miso can provide life-sustaining nourishment decades after it is made.</p> <p>Until modern times, most Japanese families started their day with a bowl of miso soup (many still do). In fact, it is not unusual for families living in the countryside, where there are fewer food choices, to have miso several times a day. According to our miso teacher, Takamichi Onozaki, as recently as the 1960s, it was common for rural families to make their own miso or buy unfermented (raw) miso from the local miso maker to ferment in their homes. Each family took pride in fermenting its own miso, and the subtle difference between various homemade varieties was often the subject of endless conversation. This preference for &#x201c;home brews&#x201d; extended beyond the home to include hundreds of local variations, which represented the different regions and climates of the Japanese islands. Names such as Tsugaru, Kaga, Gozen, Sanuki, Fuchu, and Setouchi are just a few of the hundreds of local and regional varieties of miso, each with its own characteristic flavor, texture, and color.</p> <p><strong><i>The Miso Book</i></strong> includes everything you will ever want to know about this healthy, delicious, and versatile food. Part One, appropriately titled &#x201c;All About Miso,&#x201d; includes three informative chapters on various aspects of miso. Chapter 1, &#x201c;Shedding Light on Miso,&#x201d; presents some miso basics&#x2015;how it is made, the ingredients used, and the various types. It also offers helpful tips on how to determine product quality before making a miso purchase. Chapter 2, &#x201c;Miso Medicine,&#x201d; offers a comprehensive report on miso&#x2019;s incredible health benefits, which are supported by the scientific research of several countries (as well as traditional Japanese folklore). Little-known facts about miso&#x2019;s extraordinary healing power will amaze and inspire you to include this food in your daily diet. Chapter 3 guides you in &#x201c;Making Miso at Home.&#x201d; Before the Second World War, it was common for the Japanese people to make their own miso, using generations-old family recipes. This chapter offers clear, easy-to-follow instructions to help you start your own family tradition of putting up miso.</p> <p>Rounding out Part One are two fascinating insets on the production of this Japanese mainstay. In &#x201c;The Miso Master&#x2019;s Apprentice,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll hear the true story of the apprenticeship we served under miso master Takamichi Onozaki. It was in his small family-run shop in rural Japan that we learned the ancient craft of miso making&#x2015;an experience that changed our lives forever. &#x201c;Breakfast of Em�per�ors&#x201d; takes a look at one of Japan&#x2019;s oldest and most prestigious miso factories. More than a business, the Hatcho Miso Company is a Japanese institution; one that has also has played an important role in Japan&#x2019;s military history.</p> <p>Part Two of <strong><i>The Miso Book</i> </strong>begins with a chapter that details everything you&#x2019;ll need to know when cooking with this exceptional food. It includes general guidelines as well as specific tips for using miso to create dishes that are both healthful and delicious. The balance of chapters in Part Two offers over 140 easy-to-follow recipes that include miso in a wide variety of appetizers, entr�es, and everything in between. You&#x2019;ll find flavorful salad dressings, satisfying soups, delicious sauces, sensational seafood dishes, and much, much more. Many of these recipes are traditional family favorites, some are new creations, and others are adaptations of dishes we&#x2019;ve enjoyed at fine restaurants. Best of all, the recipes are easy to prepare&#x2015;even the novice cook will find success.</p> <p>Miso is a super food; by simply having a bowl of miso soup each day, you can begin to experience its health benefits. But if you want to enjoy miso&#x2019;s full culinary potential, incorporate it a number of dishes, beginning with the choices offered in this book. With miso as a part of your diet, you&#x2019;ll soon discover for yourself why it is considered such a dietary asset in the Japanese cuisine.</p></p><h2>Gluten-Free Baking Classics for the Bread Machine</h2><p>Bread may be the staff of life, but if it contains gluten it can trigger an allergic reaction, and even provoke serious digestive disorders like celiac disease. Consumers who love bread but must avoid gluten have long been at the mercy of mediocre products and high prices. With this timely cookbook, they can have their bread and eat it, too. Acclaimed author Analise Roberts developed these simple, foolproof recipes for the Zojirushi bread machine. Roberts&#39; outstanding recipes range from simple and satisfying Basic Sandwich Bread to complex and scrumptious Golden Italian Bread with Raisins and Fennel. She also offers ethnic breads like Challah and Babka and seasonal delights such as the irresistible Holiday Breakfast Bread. Included are loaves, like Sundried Tomato Roasted Garlic Bread, that contain no eggs or dairy products.</p><p>My philosophy about gluten-free baking is that it should be simple. Most gf bakers I know don't want to reach for six different flours every time they bake- and neither do I.&nbsp;Wheat bakers use only two flours- all purpose for cakes, pies, muffins and cookies, and bread flour for bread. I do the same: I have an all-purpose brown rice flour mix (extra finely ground brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca starch) for my all purpose flour and the bread flour mix&nbsp;(millet, sorghum, potato starch, tapioca starch and corn starch)&nbsp;in this book for my breads.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy- and it increases your learning curve. If you use a different combination of flours each time you bake, how will you know what goes wrong- or right? Baking pros don't do this; that is how they become skilled in their craft.&nbsp;<br>Moreover, wheat bakers enhance the taste and texture of their breads with other added flours (whole wheat, rye, etc.) and so do I. I recommend using whole grain teff and ground oatmeal (my favorites), Montina, amaranth, or quinoa. I give recommendations as to how to do this in the book.&nbsp; --From the AuthorAnnalise Roberts co-writes for the website foodphilosopher.com.

In the static that follows the loss of a job or an apartment or a boyfriend, what can you grab onto for orientation? The narrator wonders what happens to the sense of self when the illusion of security has been stripped away. And for an indigenous person, how do these lost markers of identity echo larger cultural losses and erasures in a changing political landscape? In part taking its cue from A.R. Ammons&#x2019;s Garbage, Teebs names this liminal space &#x201c;Junk,&#x201d; in the sense that a junk shop is full of old things waiting for their next use; different items that collectively become indistinct.

H. Auden, Carson McCullers, Jane and Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, and Gypsy Rose Lee, Under One Roof in Brooklyn</h2><p>February House is the uncovered story of an extraordinary experiment in communal living, one involving young but already iconic writers -- and the country's best-known burlesque performer -- in a house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn during 1940 and 1941. It was a fevered yearlong party fueled by the appetites of youth and by the shared sense of urgency to take action as artists in the months before America entered the war.<br><br>In spite of the sheer intensity of life at 7 Middagh, the house was for its residents a creative crucible. Carson McCullers's two masterpieces, The Member of the Wedding and The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, were born, bibulously, in Brooklyn. Gypsy Rose Lee, workmanlike by day, party girl by night, wrote her book The G-String Murders in her Middagh Street bedroom. Auden -- who along with Britten was being excoriated at home in England for absenting himself from the war -- presided over the house like a peevish auntie, collecting rent money and dispensing romantic advice. And yet all the while he was composing some of the most important work of his career.<br><br>Sherill Tippins's February House, enlivened by primary sources and an unforgettable story, masterfully recreates daily life at the most fertile and improbable live-in salon of the twentieth century.</p><p><p><b>SHERILL&nbsp;TIPPINS</b>&nbsp;is the author of <i>February House: The Story of W. H. Auden, Carson McCullers, Jane and Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten and Gypsy Rose Lee Under One Roof in Wartime America</i>. She lives in New York City.</p>Preface<br><br>New York is full of old people, struggling to occupy their allotted space despite the pressures of the younger generations pushing in. Elbowed by joggers, hedged in by cyclists, they make their daily odysseys to the supermarket and then retreat to the safety of their homes. As one of tens of thousands of college graduates moving to New York City in the 1970s, I was as oblivious as the next twenty-two-year-old to this segment of the population. A decade later, as a new mother in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood of brownstones facing Wall Street across the East River, I merely noted the number of people with aluminum walkers on the sidewalks as I maneuvered my child&#x2019;s stroller around them. A few years on, however, when I began volunteering to deliver meals to the housebound and got to know many of these people as individuals, I began to regret my past indifference.<br><br>Many liked to talk, and I found that I liked to listen. The octogenarian who had covered her walls with her own arresting paintings told me about the silent-film actress who had once lived at the nearby Bossert Hotel and ordered up a milk bath every day. The retired city councilman with the fierce gray eyebrows described the spectacular sunsets, enhanced by post-Depression factory fumes, that he had so enjoyed on his homeward walks over the Brooklyn Bridge. The chain-smoking former navy officer recalled the rich scent of chocolate that used to waft through the streets from a Fulton Street candy factory before World War II. I learned, too, how the Brooklyn Dodgers got their name (Brooklyn residents were once called trolley-dodgers&#x201d; because of the many speeding trolley cars on the borough&#x2019;s streets); how a working-class girl could enjoy a free daily swim at the St. George Hotel&#x2019;s swank saltwater pool (all it took was a doctor&#x2019;s note); and what Irish-American children were told when they found an orange in their Christmas stocking ( Thank Mr. Tammany, not Santy Claus&#x201d;).<br><br>Most intriguing to me, however, were the references to a house that once stood at 7 Middagh Street (pronounced mid-daw), a short, narrow lane at the neighborhood&#x2019;s northeastern tip overlooking the former dockyards and, beyond, New York Harbor. The house had been rented, one neighbor told me, by a group of well-known young poets, novelists, composers, and artists the year before America entered World War II. Aware that enormous devastation lay ahead and determined to continue contributing to the culture as long as possible, they had created an environment for themselves to support and stimulate, inspire and protect just a few blocks from where I lived.<br><br>When I learned that these residents included the poet W. H. Auden, the novelist Carson McCullers, the composer Benjamin Britten, Paul and Jane Bowles, and, of all people, the burlesque artist Gypsy Rose Lee all under thirty-five but already near the apex of their careers my interest was piqued even further. In a pictorial survey of Brooklyn&#x2019;s history, I found a photograph of the house a small, shabby brick and brownstone structure with elaborate Tudor trim. The man who had signed the lease and organized this experiment in communal living turned out to have been George Davis, a fiction editor at Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar who had single-handedly revolutionized the role played by popular magazines in bringing serious literature and avant- garde ideas to the American masses. Davis was known for his attraction to the eccentric in culture, in entertainment, and in his choice of friends. With his encouragement, nights at the Middagh Street house became a fevered year-long party in which New York&#x2019;s artistic elite (Aaron Copland, George Balanchine, Louis Untermeyer, Janet Flanner, and Louise Dahl-Wolfe, among others) mingled with a flood of �migr�s fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe, including the composer Kurt Weill and the singer Lotte Lenya, the artist Salvador Dal� and his wife, Gala, and the entire brilliant family of the Nobel Prize winning novelist Thomas Mann. Days, however, were dedicated to their work writing, composing, painting, and otherwise seeking new answers, new approaches to life in a collapsing world.<br><br>By the winter of 1940 41, 7 Middagh called February House&#x201d; by the diarist Anads Nin because so many of its residents had been born in that month had developed a reputation as the greatest artistic salon of the decade. Denis de Rougemont, the author of Love in the Western World, claimed that all that was new in America in music, painting, or choreography emanated from that house, the only center of thought and art that I found in any large city in the country.&#x201d; Throughout the months of that suspenseful season, as Hitler&#x2019;s armies tightened their hold on Europee and killed or wounded thousands of British citizens in bombing raids, Thomas Mann&#x2019;s son Klaus labored in the Middagh Street dining room, assssssembling essays, poems, short stories, and reviews for Decision, a monthly review of free culture,&#x201d; while upstairs in the parlor, the British �migr�s Benjamin Britten and W. H. Auden worked together on an American&#x201d; opera that would express their hopes for and misgivings about their adopted country. On the third floor, McCullers agonized over the opening paragraphs of The Member of the Wedding, while in the room next door George Davis coached Gypsy on her own project, a comic burlesque mystery novel called The G-String Murders. Bowles, then a composer, wrote a ballet score in the cellar while his wife, Jane, did Auden&#x2019;s typing and wrote her own novel, Two Serious Ladies. Oliver Smith, destined to become one of Broadway&#x2019;s most prolific set designers and producers but then a destitute twenty-two-year-old, washed the dishes, tended the furnace, and, like many youngest children,&#x201d; took on the role of family peacemaker. Auden, one of the greatest poets of his generation, served as housemaster to this lively household which at one point included several circus performers and a chimpanzee collecting the rent, dispensing romantic advice, playing word games with his housemates, and strictly enforcing nighttime curfews all while laying the groundwork for some of the most courageous and original work of his career.<br><br>Perhaps inevitably, the intensity of life at 7 Middagh and the pressures created by the war in Europe led to physical and emotional breakdowns, domestic disputes, and creative crises. Even as the residents succumbed to the pressure of the times, so too did the United States. The attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, provoked America&#x2019;s entry into the fiercest and most destructive war in history a six-year conflagration that killed fifty-five million people before it ended. As the artists of 7 Middagh Street had expected, they were scattered in all directions by these events. Some enlisted as soldiers. Others used their skills to create propaganda, conduct surveys, or entertain the troops. And, in the sweeping changes that took place over the next half-decade, 7 Middagh Street itself disappeared, torn down to make way for the construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Today, nothing remains but an unmarked stretch of sidewalk, a wire fence, and a precipitous drop to the lanes of traffic speeding from one borough to the next.<br><br>What does remain is the work these artists created. The final parts of Auden&#x2019;s book The Double Man, his poems The Dark Years,&#x201d; If I Could Tell You,&#x201d; In Sickness and in Health,&#x201d; and the brilliant and innovative oratorio For the Time Being, were all completed during or inspired by the year at 7 Middagh. The twenty-seven-year-old Benjamin Britten gained both the artistic experience and the emotional growth necessary to create his first great opera, Peter Grimes. Carson McCullers&#x2019;s two final masterpieces, The Member of the Wedding and The Ballad of the Sad Caf�, were born in Brooklyn. Auden&#x2019;s support helped Jane Bowles take the first necessary steps toward completing her only serious novel, while Paul Bowles&#x2019;s jealousy over their relationship spurred him toward the writing of fiction for which he is now largely known. Even Gypsy&#x2019;s G-String Murders, written with the help of her admiring housemates, became a 1941 bestseller, establishing her reputation, not just as a stripper who could write, but as a writer who also knew how to keep an audience entranced.<br><br>Frequently, I go out of my way to pass the dead-end street where the house once stood just to remind myself that these extraordinary artists actually occupied the space I do now living together, arguing, laughing, creating, and using their imaginations to increase others&#x2019; awareness of the issues and choices laid bare in that horrible, horrifying time. If we don&#x2019;t act now, when will we? they asked themselves in choosing this shared creative life. If we don&#x2019;t use our talents to find a new way to live, who will?<br><br>How this houseful of geniuses answered those questions is the story my elderly neighbors wanted me to hear. But the questions themselves are what keep me coming back, dreaming of the house at 7 Middagh.<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Sherill Tippins.

Each tradition embodies a historically shaped perspective on the beliefs, practices and priorities that make up a Christian community. Whether you are an insider to one tradition, a hybrid of two or three, or--as many Christians today--an outsider to all, <em>Exploring Protestant Traditions</em> is a richly informative field guide to eight prominent Protestant theological traditions: Lutheran, Anabaptist, Reformed, Anglican, Baptist, Wesleyan, Dispensational and Pentecostal. Clearly and evenhandedly, W. David Buschart traces the histories of each tradition, explains their interpretive approaches to Scripture and identifies their salient beliefs. As a result, you will gain a sense of what it is to believe and worship as a Reformed or Pentecostal Christian, who the traditions' heroes are and where the "theological accents" are placed. Charts displaying the denominational representatives of each tradition and bibliographies mapping the path for further explorations add to the value of this guide. This is a book that seeks to receive rather than evaluate, to listen and understand rather than judge or correct. His is a model of theological hospitality that encourages you to open your doors to the varied ways in which Protestantism has taken root in history and human society. Some things take time, like coming to know a religious tradition. But <em>Exploring Protestant Traditions</em> is an excellent place to start.</p><p>W. David Buschart (PhD, Drew University) is associate dean and professor of theology and historical studies at Denver Seminary. He is the author of <em>Exploring Protestant Traditions: An Invitation to Theological Hospitality</em> and is coeditor of and a contributor to <em>Scholarship, Sacraments, and Service</em>. He has published a number of articles, essays and book chapters and is a member of the American Academy of Religion and the Evangelical Theological Society. Buschart served in the theology department at Canadian Theological Seminary from 1988 to 1998 and also served as acting dean of the faculty for one year. He was a founding member of the Research Science and Ethics Advisory Committee at Wascana Rehabilitation Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan and is also the founder of Credo Consulting, a theological consulting firm. He and his wife Nancy are active members of the Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church in Greenwood Village, Colorado.. . .a "one-stop-shop" for an overview of various strains of Protestantism. (Chuck Bumgardner, Orchard Keeper, January 1, 2008)<br><br>"Buschart offers a book that delves neatly into both theology and church history without becoming a work on the history of doctrine. . . . Hopes that deeper understanding will encourage theological 'hospitality.' This is not watered-down ecumenism but a challenge to see one another in the best possible and charitable light." (D. M. Whitford, United Theological Seminary, CHOICE, May 2007, Vol. 44, No. 09)<br><br>"Those looking for information on the theologies of the various Protestant traditions will like this book for its compactness and its short bibliographies." (Br. Benet Exton, O.S.B., on Curled Up with a Good Book (curledup.com))<br><br>"What a service this careful and thoughtful look at eight Protestant traditions is! Well organized, clear, up to date. This is a solid primer in what makes Protestants both alike and different. Well done. This work helps us understand each other better; a real contribution to the church." (Darrell Bock, Research Professor of New Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This book is a wonderful contribution to historical and ecumenical theology. <em>Exploring Protestant Traditions: An Invitation to Theological Hospitality</em> judiciously surveys eight ecclesio-theological traditions of Protestant theology: Lutheran, Anabaptist, Reformed, Anglican, Baptist, Wesleyan, Dispensational and Pentecostal. This gracious work is a call to ecumenical hospitality that responds to God's hospitality and recognizes diversity in belief and theology among the particular traditions and communities incarnate in the church. I will use this text as a textbook in my introductions to the history of Christianity courses, and I would recommend it for courses in ecumenism. It is rich with personal stories, encounters in these traditions, and comprehensive descriptions of the theology, hermeneutics and methods of each tradition presented. This well-written and hospitable treatment fills a need for a survey of these important Protestant traditions." (Philip D. W. Krey, President and Ministerium of New York Professor of Church History, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, and coauthor of Luther's Spirituality (forthcoming))<br><br>"Very perceptively David Buschart distinguishes the context, method and characteristic beliefs of the eight major Protestant theological traditions: Lutheran, Anabaptist, Reformed, Anglican, Baptist, Wesleyan, Dispensational and Pentecostal. With extraordinary fairness and clarity, he makes it easy to grasp not only their thematic distinctives but also provides a strong argument for their underlying similarities. He therefore shows the basis upon which a conscientious theological hospitality is possible between them, without diminishing their distinctive approaches. This is a very useful way of organizing and understanding the varieties of Protestant theology." (Thomas C. Oden, general editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture and emeritus Henry Anson Buttz professor of theology, Drew University)<br><br>"Respecting the deep, sometimes contradictory convictions of believers in various streams of the Reformation heritage, David Buschart offers an irenic overview of eight major Protestant communities. <em>Hospitality</em> is just the right word to describe this approach--a method marked by sympathy, generosity and insight. A good primer for evangelicals (and other Christians) who want a solid introduction to these living traditions." (Timothy George, dean, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University, and executive editor, Christianity Today)<br><br>"David Buschart provides a thoroughly researched, well-organized, lucid account of the histories and theological orientations of eight significantly different Protestant traditions. The significance of this becomes contemporary as he outlines the methodologies and articulations of two central beliefs in each tradition by current American theologians. An extensive, valuable resource." (Thomas Finger, author of Contemporary Anabaptist Theology)<br><br>"David Buschart's book <em>Exploring Protestant Traditions</em> lives up to its subtitle: <em>An Invitation to Theological Hospitality.</em> Well researched, objective and accurate, it is warmly sympathetic to each of the eight traditions it covers, letting each tradition speak for itself through its own theologians and historians. This book will break down many old stereotypes and be an important tool for understanding what our Christian neighbors believe." (Vinson Synan, author of The Holiness-Pentecostal Tradition and dean of Regent University School of Divinity)<br><br>"Well researched, rich in detail, clear in method and irenic in spirit, Buschart's study of eight Protestant traditions is a gift to the ecumenical church. His call for theological hospitality in the midst of the diversities that divide is a welcome emphasis that honestly acknowledges theological varieties, while aiming for the greater good of 'moving toward the full experience and expression of unity in Jesus Christ.' Students and inquirers of all perspectives will realize this book renders a real service by providing historical and theological understandings of the traditions, but also by viewing these differences as opportunities for an ecumenical hospitality that is grounded in God's love. This Christian hospitality can transcend boundaries and extend grace and generosity--notes needed today by adherents of all Protestant traditions." (Donald K. McKim, author of Introducing the Reformed Faith and editor of The Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith)</p><h2>Knit Your Own Murder (A Needlecraft Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the <i>USA Today</i> bestselling Needlecraft Mysteries, Betsy Devonshire has her hands tied between running her needlework shop and turning her sharp eye for deduction to solve a knotty murder at a local fund-raiser...<br></b><br>The Monday Bunch and other local knitters are participating in a fund-raising auction to save a community center, creating a growing pile of stuffed animals and toys right in front of the auctioneers as the audience bids.

Are the perspectives of religious believers acceptable in an academic setting? In this lucid and penetrating essay, Nicholas Wolterstorff ranges from Max Weber and John Locke to Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Taylor to argue that religious orientations and voices do have a home in the modern university, and he offers a sketch of what that home should be like.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He documents the remarkable changes have occurred within the academy over the past five decades with regard to how knowledge is understood. During the same period, profound philosophical advancements have also been made in our understanding of religious belief. These shifting ideals, taken together, have created an environment that is more pluralistic than secular. Tapping into larger debates on freedom of expression and intellectual diversity, Wolterstorff believes a scholarly ethic should guard us against becoming, in Weber&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;specialists without spirit and sensualists without heart.&#x201d;</p><p>In this penetrating essay, renowned philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff ranges from Max Weber and John Locke to Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Taylor to offer a compelling defense of religion&#x2019;s place within a secular university.<b>Nicholas Wolterstorff</b> is Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology at Yale University.

But the tale she weaves, of her missing husband, a renowned English professor, and her lost stepson, a soldier killed on a battlefield on the other side of the world, and of phantasmal visions, a family curse, and a house &#x2014; the Belvedere House, a striking mansion whose features suggest a face hidden just out of view &#x2014; draws him in, capturing him. What follows is a deeply psychological ghost story of memory and malediction, loss and remorse.<br> This unnerving tour de force, exploring the literary haunted house, from Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, and H. P. Lovecraft to today, incorporates family trauma, abstract art, literary criticism, the occult Dickens, and the war in Afghanistan. From John Langan (Mr. Gaunt and Other Uneasy Encounters) comes House of Windows, a chilling novel in the tradition of Peter Straub, Joe Hill, and Laird Barron.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.

Langan has been nominated for the International Horror Guild Award and the Bram Stoker Award. He is an adjunct instructor at SUNY New Paltz, where he teaches classes in creative writing and Gothic literature. He lives in New York's Hudson Valley with his wife, younger son, and a house full of animals, some of whom he suspects move his things while he's asleep. (He's looking at you, cats.)A two-time International Horror Guild Award finalist for short fiction, Langan pens a surprisingly plodding first novel. Lovely widow Veronica Croydon corners the unnamed narrator at a party and offers to relate the weird story of her husband, Roger, and his disappearance. She spins an odd tale of adultery, family struggles and a house possibly haunted by the spirit of Roger's son, Ted, a Special Forces officer who died in Afghanistan after Roger disowned and cursed him. Though Veronica's story spans two nights, the level of detail stretches the confessional conceit well beyond the bounds of believability. Literary allusions offer a spark of interest, but even fans of Lovecraft and Peter Straub, whom Langan tries hard to emulate, will find it difficult to navigate the unnecessary tangents and repetitious minutiae that plague this pseudoliterary potboiler. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Commander Colin Maclntyre, it began as a routine training flight over the Moon. For Dahak, a self-aware Imperial battleship, it began millennia ago when that powerful artificial intelligence underwent a mutiny in the face of the enemy. The mutiny was never resolved--Dahak was forced to maroon not just the mutineers but the entire crew on prehistoric Earth. Dahak has been helplessly waiting as the descendants of the loyal crew regressed while the mutineers maintained control of technology that kept them alive as the millennia passed. <br><br>But now Dahak's sensors indicate that the enemy that devastated the Imperium so long ago has returned--and Earth is in their path. For the sake of the planet, Dahak must mobilize its defenses. And that it cannot do until the mutineers are put down. So Dahak has picked Colin Maclntyre to be its new captain. <br><br>Now Maclntyre must mobilize humanity to destroy the mutineers once and for all--or Earth will become a cinder in the path of galactic conquest.</p><p></p><h2>Owlflight (Valdemar: Darian&#39;s Tale, Book 1)</h2><p>Apprenticed to a venerable wizard when his hunter and trapper parents disappear into the forest never to be seen again, Darian is difficult and strong willed--much to the dismay of his kindly master. But a sudden twist of fate will change his life forever, when the ransacking of his village forces him to flee into the great mystical forest. It is here in the dark forest that he meets his destiny, as the terrifying and mysterious Hawkpeople lead him on the path to maturity. Now they must lead the assault on his besieged home in a desperate attempt to save his people from certain death!</p><p>Mercedes Lackey is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling <b>Heralds Of Valdemar</b> series. She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots.Stand-alone Valdemar yarn from the wife-and-husband team (The Silver Gryphon, 1996, etc.). Chronologically, this follows the events of Storm Breaking (not reviewed), but it's otherwise unconnected. Young orphan Darian lives on the edge of the vast Pelagiris forest. Though apprenticed to the wise old wizard Justyn, he's contemptuous of magic in general and unwilling to make the effort to develop his own talents. When invading barbarians burn the village and kill Justyn, Darian flees into the forest and meets the Hawkbrothers, a magical elflike race who bond with birds and bear such names as Snowfire, Starfall, and Nightwind. What ensues is a standard coming-of-age fantasy involving the usual Lackey and Dixon suspects (yes, of course, gryphons).

None truly reflects how liturgy shapes theology or is theology or even relates to theology.</p><p>This work is Father Kavanagh's effort to substantiate the existence of a truly liturgical theology. It will raise almost as many questions as it answers, but it will also further insight into theology and liturgy as it assays their relationship.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Cry from the Dust (A Gwen Marcey Novel)</h2><p><b>Carol Award winner for best mystery/suspense/thriller of 2015</b>awarded by ACFW (American Christian Fiction Writers),&nbsp;Finalist: the Christy Awards.

Their society was driven by an insatiable lust for culinary delights &#x2013; especially fish &#x2013; fine wine and pleasures of the flesh. Indeed, great fortunes were squandered and politicians&#x2019; careers ruined through ritual drinking at the symposium, or the wooing of highly-coveted, costly prostitutes.</p><p>James Davidson brings an incisive eye and an urbane wit to this refreshingly accessible and different history of the people who invented Europe, democracy and art.</p></p><p>Desire is a dangerous thing, and the relationship between the citizens of ancient Athens and their desires was a complex and troubled one. James Davidson's <i>Courtesans and Fishcakes</i> is a brilliant and kaleidoscopic examination of daily life in classical Athens, and the life he reveals is simultaneously more alien and more familiar than we might have imagined. From fish-guzzling gourmands to the ambiguous eroticism of vase paintings, the cradle of Western culture is artfully, and frequently amusingly, anatomized. Davidson believes that many historians, under the influence of Foucault, are guilty of imposing modern views of desire, and particularly sexuality, on Greek culture, resulting in a simplistic interpretation of what was an extremely complicated issue. He refutes the prevailing opinion that sex in Athens was a simple binary opposition of penetrator and penetrated, drawing on a remarkable number of sources to show how sexuality was a slippery commodity rooted in intricate social negotiations, a characteristic shared with many other objects of desire, from eels to undiluted wine. Davidson sometimes assumes a little too much knowledge on the part of his audience--some basic information about the size of the Athenian population would have been helpful--but in spite of this <i>Courtesans and Fishcakes</i> is both accessible and provocative, offering a fascinating portrait of the private and public lives of ancient Athenians. <i>--Simon Leake</i><p>&#x201c;A most enjoyable book about enjoyment.&#x201d;<br>PETER STOTHARD,'The Times'</p><p>&#x201c;James Davidson&#x2019;s concern is with ancient appetites: food, drink and sex in classical Athens. At one level, he provides a guided tour from bordello to Billingsgate; at another, an essay on the politics of consumption. Fish did loom large: it was the gourmet food, and therefore the social indicator. Literary critics found it extraordinary that the heroes of the Iliad lived on kebabs, though they were camped near the rich fishing grounds of the Dardanelles. This is a book of many pleasures, both in analysis and in anecdote. You can meet heroes of hedonism and martyrs of sensuality: Melanthios, who prayed for a neck like a heron&#x2019;s, so that he could linger long on the delicious mouthfuls; Philoxenos, who consumed a three foot octopus (except for the head), and nearly died of dyspepsia; the anonymous alcoholic immortalised by Aristotle, who put eggs under his mat and sat on them and drank continuously until they hatched. Davidson presents a superior class of hedonist ... His invigorating book paints the scene with polished scholarship and fine Hellenic gusto.&#x201d;<br>PETER PARSONS'London Review of Books'</p><p>&#x201c;Davidson blows away a whole heap of cobwebs, and at the same time shows up with merciless clarity the dissimulation and hypocrisy at the heart of some modern attitudes. We learn about where tarts took their clients, their tarifs and repertoire of sexual positions (the one called &#x2018;lion on the cheesegrater&#x2019; is a puzzler); about the quaint games of kottabos (flicking the remains of one&#x2019;s wine at a target) and quail tapping (you rapped a quail on the head and bet on whether it stood its ground or backed off); about the price of fresh eels and barracuda; about plonk and best vintage Chian wine. All students of antiquity will have to have this book.&#x201d;<br>CHRISTOPHER STACE, 'Daily Telegraph'</p><p>&#x201c;If little boys are still being made to learn dead languages, and expected to enjoy 'Everyday Life in Ancient Greece', I hope their Greek master reads James Davidson&#x2019;s fascinating and witty book, and tells them the best stories from it. This certainly ought to wake them up at the back of the class.&#x201d;<br>HUMPHREY CARPENTER,'Sunday Times'</p><p>&#x201c;An excellent and learned exploration of a subject which for 50 years has crumbled to dust whenever touched.

In each case, the juxtaposition of original and doctored images reveals how easily history can be distorted.</p><p>In Stalinist Russia, it was commonplace for Soviet history to be rewritten with inconvenient participants removed--often men or women who had aided the Communist Revolution in the early days and then had somehow fallen afoul of Stalin himself. In <i>The Commissar Vanishes</i>, English art historian David King assembles an impressive body of photographs and artwork that shows the process whereby a hero could overnight be made into villain. "The physical eradication of Stalin's political opponents at the hands of the secret police was swiftly followed by their obliteration from all forms of pictorial existence," King rightly notes: in one noteworthy sequence reproduced on the cover, a photograph of Stalin with three revolutionary leaders is airbrushed and cropped and clipped until, one by one, those leaders disappear and only Stalin is left--conveying the message that Stalin carried the Russian Revolution by himself. Another photograph from the 1920s depicts a meeting of dozens of trade-union and Bolshevik leaders; by the late 1930s, all but a handful of them had been murdered at Stalin's orders. King's work restores some of these men and women to history and illustrates the essential inhumanity of totalitarian thought.During the past three decades, author and photo-historian David King has assembled the world&#x2019;s largest archive of doctored photographs, posters, and painting from the Soviet era. King began his collection during a trip to Russia in 1970, when he discovered that thousands of images of Stalin&#x2019;s victims had been lost to posterity&#x2014;either by design or neglect. His collection has grown to more than a quarter million images, the best of which have been selected for <i>The Commissar Vanishes</i>.<br></p><h2>Country Girl (Back Bay Readers&#39; Pick)</h2><p><strong>"<em>Country Girl</em> is Edna O'Brien's exquisite account of her dashing, barrier-busting, up-and-down life."--National Public Radio</strong><br><br>When Edna O'Brien's first novel, <em>The Country Girls</em>, was published in 1960, it so scandalized the O'Briens' local parish that the book was burned by its priest.

A long introduction orients the reader and discusses a few of the difficulties faced by Ibn al-Arabi&#x2019;s interpreters. Like Chittick&#x2019;s earlier work, The Sufi Path of Knowledge, this book is based primarily on Ibn al-Arabi&#x2019;s monumental work, al-Futuhat al-makkiyya &#x201c;The Meccan Openings.&#x201d; More than one hundred complete chapters and subsections are translated, not to mention shorter passages that help put the longer discussions in context.

It is possible to be ill or live with a disability and still be well, according to theologian, educator and speaker Dawn. She should know. As a person with a variety of serious physical challenges, and who has grappled with emotional and bodily issues as well as theological and biblical questions, Dawn is a powerful guide for those who want to be well in spite of their medical conditions. While she has written about her disabilities in previous books, this one is a complete and helpful analysis of the implications of physical challenges, along with concrete spiritual, theological and practical suggestions for dealing with them. Each chapter names one particular aspect of illness, such as loneliness, boredom, physical pain, regrets, bitterness or meaninglessness, and offers strategies for coping with them without sugarcoating or belittling the real struggles people face. Dawn also looks past the individual to offer a global perspective, making suggestions for addressing governments and health systems that further oppress those who are ill. Stories from the author's and others' experiences offer readers the sense of being graciously companioned along a very difficult road. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in <i>Tomatoland</i>, which is based on his James Beard Award-winning article, "The Price of Tomatoes," investigative food journalist Barry Estabrook reveals the huge human and environmental cost of the $5 billion fresh tomato industry. Fields are sprayed with more than one hundred different herbicides and pesticides. Tomatoes are picked hard and green and artificially gassed until their skins acquire a marketable hue. Modern plant breeding has tripled yields, but has also produced fruits with dramatically reduced amounts of calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and tomatoes that have fourteen times more sodium than the tomatoes our parents enjoyed. The relentless drive for low costs has fostered a thriving modern-day slave trade in the United States. How have we come to this point?<br><br>Estabrook traces the supermarket tomato from its birthplace in the deserts of Peru to the impoverished town of Immokalee, Florida, a.k.a. the tomato capital of the United States. He visits the laboratories of seedsmen trying to develop varieties that can withstand the rigors of agribusiness and still taste like a garden tomato, and then moves on to commercial growers who operate on tens of thousands of acres, and eventually to a hillside field in Pennsylvania, where he meets an obsessed farmer who produces delectable tomatoes for the nation's top restaurants.<br><br>Throughout <i>Tomatoland</i>, Estabrook presents a who's who cast of characters in the tomato industry: the avuncular octogenarian whose conglomerate grows one out of every eight tomatoes eaten in the United States; the ex-Marine who heads the group that dictates the size, color, and shape of every tomato shipped out of Florida; the U.S. attorney who has doggedly prosecuted human traffickers for the past decade; and the Guatemalan peasant who came north to earn money for his parents' medical bills and found himself enslaved for two years.<br><br><i>Tomatoland</i> reads like a suspenseful whodunit as well as an expose of today's agribusiness systems and the price we pay as a society when we take taste and thought out of our food purchases.</p><p>James Beard Award-winning journalist Barry Estabrook was a contributing editor at <i>Gourmet</i> magazine for eight years, writing investigative articles about where food comes from. He was the founding editor of <i>Eating Well</i> magazine and has written for the <i>New York Times Magazine, Reader's Digest, Men's Health, Audubon</i>, and the <i>Washington Post</i>, and contributes regularly to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>'s website. His work has been anthologized in the Best American Food Writing series, and he has been interviewed on numerous television and radio shows. He lives and grows tomatoes in his garden in Vermont."In this eye-opening expos�, Vermont journalist Estabrook traces the sad, tasteless life of the mass-produced tomato, from its chemical-saturated beginnings in south Florida to far-flung supermarkets. Expanding on his 2010 James Beard Award-winning article in Gourmet magazine, Estabrook first looks at the tomato's ancestors in Peru, grown naturally in coastal deserts and Andean foothills, with fruit the size of large peas. Crossbreeding produced bigger, juicier varieties, and by the late 19th century, Florida had muscled in on the U.S. market, later benefiting from the embargo on Cuban tomatoes; the Sunshine State now produces one-third of the fresh tomatoes in this country. To combat sandy soil devoid of nutrients, and weather that breeds at least 27 insect species and 29 diseases that prey on the plants, Florida growers bombard tomato plants with a dizzying cocktail of herbicides and pesticides, then gas the "mature greens" (fruit plucked so early from the vines that they bounce without a scratch) with ethylene. Behind the scenes, moreover, there exists a horrendous culture of exploitation of Hispanic laborers in places like Immokalee, where pesticide exposure has led to birth defects and long-term medical ailments. Estabrook concludes this thought-provoking book with some ideas from innovators trying to build a better tomato." --Publisher's Weekly<br><br>"With great skill and compassion, Estabrook explores the science, ingenuity, and human misery behind the modern American tomato. Once again, the true cost is too high to pay." --Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation<br><br>"In my ten years as editor of Gourmet magazine, the article I am proudest to have published was Barry Estabrook's 'The Price of Tomatoes.' Now he's expanded that into this astonishingly moving and important book. If you have ever eaten a tomato--or ever plan to--you must read Tomatoland. It will change the way you think about America's most popular 'vegetable.' More importantly, it will give you new insight into the way America farms." --Ruth Reichl, author of Garlic and Sapphires<br><br>"If you worry, as I do, about the sad and sorry state of the tomato today, and want to know what a tomato used to be like and what it could hopefully become again, read Barry Estabrook's Tomatoland. This book is a fascinating history of the peregrination of the tomato throughout the centuries." --Jacques P�pin, author of the forthcoming Essential Pepin<br><br>"In fast-moving, tautly narrated scenes, Barry Estabrook tells the startling story of labor conditions that should not exist in this country or this century, and makes sure you won't look at a supermarket or fast-food tomato the same way again.

This book is in some way a sequel to <i>Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light</i>, in which her own very private spiritual struggles were explained.&nbsp; Sent to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, she assumed their struggles and pain in the depths of her heart. This led to particularly intense anguish which she lived through with heroic courage and fidelity over several decades.&nbsp; As important as this aspect of her life is, that remarkable testimony of her life and her words intensifies the need and desire to know more of her thought.&nbsp; There is much she can teach us as we face our daily struggles or sufferings, which can at times be unusually severe. &nbsp;<i>Where There is Love, There is God, </i>though not an exhaustive anthology of Mother Teresa&#x2019;s teaching, nonetheless shows what she believed and taught about important issues that confront all people. Due to her constant interaction with people of diverse backgrounds, no life situation was foreign to her and in this book her role is primarily one of teacher and guide. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Love</i> is perhaps the word that best summarizes Mother Teresa&#x2019;s life and message. The title reflects what she proclaimed during her entire life: God is alive, present, and &#x201c;still loves the world through you and through me&#x201d;. &nbsp;Mother Teresa sought to be an extension of God&#x2019;s heart and hands in the world of today. She was called to be a missionary of charity, a carrier of God&#x2019;s love to each person she met, especially those most in need. Yet she did not think that this was a vocation uniquely hers; each person is in some way called to be a carrier of God&#x2019;s love. Through the practical and timely advice she offers, Mother Teresa sets us on the path to closer union with God and greater love for our brothers and sisters.<br>&nbsp;<br>MOTHER TERESA (1910&#x2013;1997) was born in Skopje (present-day Macedonia), and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin in 1928. She left the Loreto order in 1948 to begin the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Her service to the poorest of the poor became her life&#x2019;s work. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and was beatified in 2003. Editor of Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, FATHER BRIAN KOLODIEJCHUK, M.C., Ph.D., was associated with Mother Teresa for twenty years and is now director of the Mother Teresa Center, which has offices in California, Mexico, India, and Italy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What you are doing I cannot do, what I&#x2019;m doing you cannot do, but together we are doing something beautiful for God, and this is the greatness of God&#x2019;s love for us&#x2014;To give us the opportunity to become holy through the works of love that we do because holiness is not the luxury of the few. It is a very simple duty for you, for me, you in your position, in your work and I and others, each one of us in the work, in the life that we have given our word of honor to God....You must put your love for God in a living action.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>-Mother Teresa, From <i>Where There is Love, There is God</i></p><p><b>MOTHER TERESA</b> (1910-1997) was born in Skopje (present-day Macedonia), and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin in 1928. She left the Loreto order in 1948 to begin the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Her service to the poorest of the poor became her life's work. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and was beatified in 2003.<b><i>God Is Love</i></b><br>In reply to the question &#x201c;What or who is God?&#x201d; Mother Teresa on one occasion said, &#x201c;God is love and He loves you and we are precious to Him. He called us by our name. We belong to Him. He has created us in His image for greater things. God is love, God is joy, God is light, God is truth.&#x201d; <br>This statement encapsulates her belief in God and her experience of Him: God exists and is the Source of all that exists; His very being is love; He has created us in his likeness with spiritual powers of intellect and free will, with the ability to know and to love; He is a Father who loves each of us uniquely, personally, and He ardently desires our happiness. No hardship or suffering, her own or that of her poor, could undermine Mother Teresa&#x2019;s conviction that God IS love, that all He does or permits is ultimately for some greater good and, therefore, an expression of His immense and unconditional love. St. Augustine wrote at the beginning of his <i>Confessions:</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>It was Mother Teresa&#x2019;s conviction that all people &#x201c;deep down in their heart, believe in God.&#x201d; There is a longing for God in each of us and though it may not be recognized or consciously expressed as such, the search for joy, for peace, for happiness and above all for love, is a manifestation of this longing. Though the desire, or &#x201c;hunger&#x201d; for God, as Mother Teresa expressed it, is implanted in every human heart, entering into a relationship with Him depends largely on our cooperation with His grace. The freedom to cooperate or not is yet another expression of the love and respect that God has for each of His human creatures. He does not force Himself on anyone; He leaves it to our choice. Yet, the response befitting a creature before its Creator, who is infinite love and wisdom ought to be one of love and trust, praise and adoration, recognition and thanksgiving. Loved so greatly by God, each person is called to share that love; as Mother Teresa often affirmed: &#x201c;We have been created for greater things, to love and to be loved.&#x201d; To love as God loves, meeting daily with Him through prayer is essential. Without it love dies. Mother Teresa stressed its importance by saying, &#x201c;What blood is to the body, prayer is to the soul.&#x201d; But to enter into prayer, silence is necessary, for &#x201c;in the silence of the heart God speaks.&#x201d; Her aphorism expressing these truths has become well known:<br>&nbsp;<br>The fruit of silence is prayer;<br>the fruit of prayer is faith;<br>the fruit of faith is love;<br>the fruit of love is service,<br>the fruit of service is peace.<br>&nbsp;<br>This simple yet profound saying places silence as the point of departure for practical love, peace, and service. As Mother Teresa asserted: &#x201c;Silence is at the root of our union with God and with one another.&#x201d; Silence and recollection are the indispensable conditions for prayer. An atmosphere of exterior silence is certainly very helpful, but Mother Teresa, who spent most of her life in large, overcrowded cities, learned to be interiorly silent and recollected in the midst of much noise and activity. She shows us that to practice silence one need not flee from the world and live as a hermit. What is necessary is to learn to quiet the mind and heart to dispose ourselves for prayer. <br>Prayer permeated Mother Teresa&#x2019;s day: she started, ended, and filled each day with prayer. Her first words upon rising were addressed to God, and throughout the day she spontaneously spoke to Him of her love and gratitude, her plans, hopes, and desires. As soon as some need or difficulty presented itself, however small and insignificant, she turned to God, making her requests with the trust and the expectation of a child dependent on its father. In addition to daily Holy Mass and the morning and evening Liturgy of the Hours (containing psalms, Scripture reading, and intercessions), traditional prayers such as the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, litanies, and novenas, kept her in continual union with God.<br>An important time of prayer for Mother Teresa was her daily half-hour meditation on the Sacred Scriptures. Formed in the traditional Ignatian method of meditating on the Word of God, principally the Gospels, Mother Teresa was led to intimate conversation and communion with God. Through this prayerful reading, the Word of God took root within her, inflaming her love, influencing her words, and directing her actions. She also nourished her soul each day with an additional half-hour given over to the reading of the lives and writings of the saints or other ascetical works. To help foster recollection throughout the day, Mother Teresa was in the practice of praying &#x201c;aspirations&#x201d;&#x2014;short prayers that raise one &#x2019;s mind and heart to God in the midst of daily activities. These repetitions were a great aid to keeping herself in God&#x2019;s presence. Through these means, she grew in deep knowledge and love of God and was able to respond to Him and to her brothers and sisters in love. Since &#x201c;love is of God&#x201d; [1 Jn 4:7], human love is to be a reflection of and a sharing in divine love, which is entirely selfless and seeks only the good of the other. <br>True love is selfgiving, self-sacrificing, a &#x201c;dying to self &#x201d; in order to love and serve others, and this was the love that Mother Teresa exemplified. In a culture where &#x201c;love&#x201d; is overly identified with feelings rather than an act of the will, with pleasure rather than sacrifice, Mother Teresa&#x2019;s life and teaching, modeled on that of Christ&#x2019;s, exemplifies the Christian ideal of love.<br>In an interview Mother Teresa was once asked, &#x201c;Can you sum up what love really is?&#x201d; She promptly replied: &#x201c;Love is giving. God loved the world so much that He gave His Son. Jesus loved the world so much, loved you, loved me so much that He gave His life. And He wants us to love as He loved. And so now we have also to give until it hurts. True love is a giving and giving until it hurts.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Who Is God?</i></b><br>God <i>is</i>. (2)<br>God is love.

So beautiful. So simple.<br>&nbsp;<br>There Must Be a God, Somewhere!<br>The other day a voluntary worker with long hair . . . was talking to me and he kept on saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in God.&#x201d; So I said to him, &#x201c;Supposing, just now, as you were talking, you got a heart attack . . . can you stop it?&#x201d; He got such a surprise that he didn&#x2019;t say that phrase any more. He was beginning to realize that, in the end, no matter how much we talk, we can&#x2019;t change the time of our death. A few days later I heard that, after a lot of thought, he was beginning to make the reservation that there must be a God, somewhere!<br>&nbsp;<br>Where There Is Love, There Is God<br>&nbsp;One man told me: &#x201c;I am an atheist,&#x201d; but he spoke so beautifully about love. Mother told him: &#x201c;You cannot be an atheist if you speak so beautifully about love. Where there is love, there is God. God is love.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Love, Not in Words<br>First, God proved to us that He loved us. God loved the world so much that He gave His son Jesus.18 And Jesus loved you, He loved me and He gave Himself on the Cross for us.19 He was not afraid to love us and He loved us until the end.20 He gave up everything that was beautiful and was really like us, a human being. He was like us in everything except sin. &nbsp;But He loved us tenderly. And to make sure that we understand His love, that we don&#x2019;t forget that He loved us, He makes Himself the hungry one, the naked one, the homeless one. And He says, &#x201c;Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it to Me.&#x201d; and explains to us what to do and how to do it. Before He taught the people, He had pity on the multitude, and He fed them. He made a miracle. He blessed the bread, and He fed five thousand people. It&#x2019;s because He loved the people. He had pity on them. He saw the hunger in their faces and He fed them. And only then He taught them. And so it is so wonderful to think that you and I, we can love God. But how, where? Where is God?<br>We believe He is everywhere. We believe that He has made you, and made me, not just to be a number in the world, but He has made us with a purpose. There is a reason for our being here. . . . And that reason is to love. You have been made to love and to be loved. That&#x2019;s why it is so wrong not to love. And that&#x2019;s the most beautiful thing that the human being has or can give: Love. Not in words. Because we are human beings [and] we want to see, we want to touch. That&#x2019;s why the poor people give us much more than we give to them&#x2014;because they give us an opportunity to love God in them. When I give a piece of bread to a hungry child, I believe what Jesus said, &#x201c;You give it to Me.&#x201d; And I give it to that child.<br>&nbsp;<br>God&#x2019;s Loving Care<br>A few weeks ago, I had the very extraordinary experience of this tenderness of God for the little one. A man came to our house with a prescription from a doctor. He said the child was dying, his only child was dying in the slums of Calcutta and that medicine could not be got in India anywhere. It had to be brought from England. As we were talking, a man came with a basket of medicines. He had gone round to the families and gathered half-used medicines for our poor people&#x2014;we have these mobile clinics all over the slums of Calcutta and all over the place, and they go round to the families and gather half-used medicines and bring them to us, and we give them to the poor people&#x2014;and there he came, and right on the top of that basket was that medicine.<br>I just couldn&#x2019;t believe because if it was inside, I would not have seen it. If he had come before or after, I would not have connected. I just stood in front of that basket and kept looking at the bottle and in my mind I was saying, &#x201c;Millions and millions and millions of children in the world&#x2014;how could God be concerned with that little child in the slums of Calcutta. To send that medicine, to send that man just at that time, to put that medicine right on the top and to send the full amount that the doctor had prescribed.&#x201d; See how precious that little one was to God Himself. How concerned He was for that little one.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>He Is Our Father</i><br>The tenderness of God&#x2019;s love&#x2014;no one can love as God. He has made us in His image. He made us. He is our Father.<br>&nbsp;<br>Father and Child<br>&#x201c;The Father loves me, He wants me, He needs me.&#x201d; That kind of attitude is our trust, our joy, our conviction. Anything may come: impatience, failures, joy, but say to yourself, &#x201c;The Father loves me.&#x201d; God has created the whole world, but He is our Father. In prayer, create that conviction from the inside: Father and child.<br>&nbsp;<br>No One Spoils Us as Much as God<br>There is great talk going on all over the world that Mother Teresa is spoiling the people by giving them things free. In Bangalore, once at a seminar, in the name of the whole group, one nun got up and said to me, &#x201c;Mother Teresa, you are spoiling the poor people by giving them things free. They are losing their human dignity. You should take at least ten naya paisa &nbsp;for what you give them, then they will feel more their human dignity.&#x201d; When everyone was quiet, I said calmly, &#x201c;No one is spoiling as much as God Himself. See the wonderful gifts He has given us freely. All of you here have no glasses, yet you all can see. Say, if God were to take money for your sight, what would happen? We are spending so much money for Shishu Bhavan25 to buy oxygen for saving life, yet continually we are breathing and living on oxygen and we do not pay anything for it. What would happen if God were to say, &#x2018;You work four hours and you will get sunshine for two hours.&#x2019; How many of us would then survive?&#x201d; Then I also told them: &#x201c;There are many congregations who spoil the rich, then it is good to have one congregation in the name of the poor, to spoil the poor.&#x201d; There was profound silence; nobody said a word after that.<br>God&#x2019;s Care One day right in the beginning, we had no rice for dinner and then a lady came and brought rice. She said she was coming back from the office &#x201c;and something in me told me to go to Mother Teresa and bring her rice.&#x201d; And so she brought rice. I said: &#x201c;Please excuse me, I will measure first and then I will tell you.&#x201d; It was exactly the amount we cooked for dinner, no less, no more, not even half a cup. I told that lady what had happened and she began to cry. She was a Hindu, and she said, &#x201c;To think that God used me, spoke in my heart. In the whole world, there are millions and millions of people, there are millions of people only in India, and God&#x2019;s concern for Mother Teresa.&#x201d; His tender love&#x2014;you must experience that . . . even when it is hard, when there is suffering, when there is humiliation.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Silence</i><br>If we talk always we cannot pray. Jesus is not present within me. We must keep silence. When a person really keeps silence, she is a holy sister.<br>&nbsp;<br>God Speaks in Silence<br>In the silence of the heart God speaks and this is the time that He will speak to you. To be able to listen you have to be like a little child. Try to have extra devotion to the Little Flower.26 She understood the Gospel very well. She realized that she had to become a little child. Read her life&#x2014;you will find nothing really special or extraordinary, but what is striking is that fidelity in small things with great love; that fidelity to silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>Listening to the Voice of God<br>Listening is the beginning of prayer, and what we listen to is the voice of God, God that cannot deceive or be deceived. Then if we keep silence, silence cannot be corrected; if we speak, if we answer back, we make mistakes.<br>In the silence of the heart God speaks; let God fill us, then only we speak. Often we say uncharitable words. They come from us, from our heart, not from God speaking through us, because we are not listening to God.<br>If you want to know how much you love Jesus there is no need to ask anybody to tell you; you are old enough. In the sincerity of your heart you will...</p><h2>A Secret History of Consciousness</h2><p>For the last four centuries, science has tried to account for everything in terms of atoms and molecules and the physical laws they adhere to. Recently, this effort was extended to try to include the inner world of human beings. Gary Lachman argues that this view of consciousness is misguided and unfounded. He points to another approach to the study and exploration of consciousness that erupted into public awareness in the late 1800s. In this &#x201c;secret history of consciousness,&#x201d; consciousness is seen not as a result of neurons and molecules, but as responsible for them; meaning is not imported from the outer world, but rather creates it. In this view, consciousness is a living, evolving presence whose development can be traced through different historical periods, and which evolves along a path to a broader, more expansive state. What that consciousness may be like and how it may be achieved is a major concern of this book .<br><br>Lachman concentrates on the period since the late 1800s, when Madame Blavatsky first brought the secret history out into the open. As this history unfolds, we encounter the ideas of many modern thinkers, from esotericists like P. D. Ouspensky, Rudolf Steiner, and Colin Wilson to more mainstream philosophers like Henri Bergson, William James, Owen Barfield and the psychologist Andreas Mavromatis. Two little known but important thinkers play a major role in his synthesis&#x2015;Jurij Moskvitin, who showed how our consciousness relates to the mechanisms of perception and to the external world, and Jean Gebser, who presented perhaps the most impressive case for the evolution of consciousness. <br><br>An important contribution to the study of consciousness ... a must-read. <br><br><b>Contents:</b> <ul> <br><li> Foreword by Colin Wilson </li><li> Introduction: Consciousness Explained </li><li> The Search for Cosmic Consciousness </li><li> Esoteric Evolution </li><li> The Archaeology of Consciousness </li><li> Participatory Epistemology </li><li> The Presence of Origin </li><li> Last Words: Playing for Time </li><li> Selected Bibliography </li></ul><br><br><br>&#x201c;A marvelously exhilarating gallop through every important modern theory of consciousness, from Steiner to Maslow, from Bucke&#x2019;s &#x2018;cosmic consciousness&#x2019; to Gebser&#x2019;s &#x2018;integral consciousness.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Colin Wilson</b>, author of <i>The Outsider</i> and <i>Access to Inner Worlds</i> <br><br> &#x201c;Opens up vast vistas of possibility, suggesting that what we experience as the earth may, in itself, be inseparable from our state of mind, and that the evolution of human consciousness may be as fundamental a process as our development through genetics.

As far as impressions went, I blew it, but I was five at the time, so he eventually forgave me. Some days I wished he hadn't particularly when we crossed paths on the job.</p><p>"Ms. Craft, this is beyond unacceptable." Henry Baker accented the statement with a plump fist slicing the air before his face. Behind him loomed Death.</p><p>Eighteen years of practice kept my gaze off the jeans-clad soul collector and on my client, whose face darkened from cherry red to bruised purple. I fingered the spray of funeral lilies at my side, dreading the direction this conversation was taking.</p><p>"Our contract stipulated I raise the shade. I did."</p><p>Baker swatted aside my protest. "You promised me results."</p><p>"I said you could ask your questions." I leaned against his father's coffin. It wasn't exactly respectful, but I'd just shoved the senior Baker's shade back into his body two hours before his funeral. Respect had nothing to do with this job. But hey, a paycheck is a paycheck.</p><p>Baker turned on his heel and stomped across the aisle. I waited. I knew what was coming. Baker was a fortune hunter a failed one at that and I'd worked with his like before.</p><p>Death followed in Baker's wake. He exaggerated each heavy step, mocking the chubby man's jerky movements. All the while, a grin clung to his lips, his dark eyes never leaving me.</p><p><i>This had better be a social visit.</i> I met his gaze, pleading, warning I didn't care which him to leave my client alone. He flashed a row of perfectly straight teeth, which didn't tell me anything.</p><p>Baker continued to pace.</p><p><i>Well, best get this part over quickly.</i> "According to our contract, you can pay by cash, check, or money order. Will you need a receipt?"</p><p>Baker jerked to a stop. His eyes bulged, the skin hanging from his cheeks shaking. "I refuse to pay for this."</p><p><i>Here we go.</i> I shoved away from the casket. "Listen, mister, you wanted a shade raised. I raised a shade. If dear old dad didn't say what you wanted, well, that's your problem, not mine. We have a binding agreement and if "</p><p>He dropped his fist, and his eyes flew wide, startled.</p><p><i>That was simpler than I expected.</i> I let out a breath to purge the rant from my tongue and pasted on my professional smile. "Now, will you need a receipt?"</p><p>Baker gripped his chest and wheezed. Once. Twice. Then, in slow motion, his neck twisted and his gaze moved over his shoulder. The amusement melted from Death's face.</p><p><i>Oh crap.</i></p><p>Angel of Death, Soul Collector, Grim Reaper whatever you called him, most people saw him only once. He strolled forward, and Baker stumbled back a step.</p><p><i>Crap.</i> I jumped from the casket platform. "Don't."</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Death reached into Baker's pudgy torso, and the color leached from my client's face. He swayed. Death stepped back, and Baker blinked once more before crumpling.</p><p>A scream rang from the corner of the room, followed by the clatter of chairs. The funeral director sprinted up the aisle, Baker's wife and teenage son behind him. His assistant, her eyes already glistening, fumbled a phone from her waistband.</p><p>"Nine-one-one," she said as Baker the third and last remaining pumped his father's chest. Poor kid.</p><p>I crept away from the commotion. Giving the family space was all I could really do. Death had already collected the soul there wasn't any way to revive Henry Baker now. Not that I was going to be the one to tell his family that fact.</p><p>Death leaned against the far wall, his muscular arms crossed over his wide chest. He smiled, all devilish innocence as his dark hair fell forward around his chin.</p><p>I glared at him and scooped my purse from the floor. I couldn't fault him for collecting Baker's soul after all, he had a job to do but...;</p><p>"You could have waited until I got paid."</p><p>He shrugged. "Didn't seem like he planned to pay you."</p><p>True. Maybe. The frantic huddle around Baker's body churned. <i>This is so going to be bad for business.</i></p><p>I shoved my hand in my purse and fished along the bottom. I ignored the billfold I knew it was empty. Under the tube of chalk for casting my circle, a ceramic ritual knife, my cell phone, and my license, I discovered three pennies, a dime, a crumpled foil wrapper, and a paper clip.</p><p>Death glanced at the treasure spread over my palm. "Planning on buying a gumball?"</p><p>"Bus fare for the trip home."</p><p>We both frowned at my palm. Thirteen cents wasn't going to cut it. But an emergency vet bill had wiped out everything I had. Until a job actually paid out, I was broke.</p><p>"Aren't you working the Amanda Holliday trial with the DA?" Death asked.</p><p>I dumped the change into my purse. "The shade won't take the stand until tomorrow, and then I have to wait for the City, or whoever, to cut the check."</p><p>I was giving the prosecution their star witness, because for once, being dead wasn't going to stop the victim from accusing her murderer. So far the headlines were mixed on whether I was the "voice of the silenced" or the "corrupter of the dead," but one thing was certain: it was big news.</p><p>More important, as long as the defense didn't rip me apart, I might end up on Nekros City's permanent payroll instead of being just an occasional consultant for the police. Then I wouldn't have to deal with fortune hunters like Henry Baker.</p><p>"You staying for this?" Death nodded toward Baker's body.</p><p>Baker's son still pumped the dead man's chest, fighting to reclaim his father, but the new widow had abandoned hope. She clung to the funeral director, who steered her toward the seats in the front row. I didn't see the assistant.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm staying. I wouldn't want to be accused of fleeing the scene."</p><p>Death shrugged, his black-clad shoulders lifting slightly. As they dropped again he vanished. I hated when he did that. One minute here; the next gone. He'd turn up again. He always did.</p><p>In my purse, Queen's Freddie Mercury belted out the line "We will rock you," and I cringed. The widow's gaze snapped to me, her mascara-ringed eyes hard.</p><p>Maybe not the best ringtone for the current situation.</p><p>Turning away, I dug my phone out and glanced at the display. I didn't know the number. <i>Let this be a job, not a bill collector.</i> I flipped it open. "You've reached Tongues for the Dead. This is Alex Craft."</p><p>"Alexis?"</p><p>I pulled the phone from my ear and frowned at the display. I still didn't know the number. <i>Who would call me </i></p><p>"Alexis," the female voice asked again. "Are you there? I need your help."</p><p>"Casey?"</p><p>Her affirmative was a choked sob. My sister never called me. What was I supposed to say to her?</p><p>"What do you need?" I asked, and then grimaced. The question had sounded a lot more sensitive in my head.</p><p>"Have you seen the paper?"</p><p>"Not today."</p><p>Casey's voice caught in her throat, and it took her two tries to whisper, "They found Teddy."</p><p><i>Teddy?</i></p><p>The angry click of high heels rang across the room, heading in my direction. <i>Uh-oh.</i> I covered the mouth of the phone with my palm as I turned. The new widow was a head shorter than me, but twice as wide, and right now it looked as if that extra weight was pure mean anger.</p><p>"You did this." Her finger drilled into my arm.</p><p><i>Oh good she's found someone to blame. Me.</i></p><p>Clearing my throat, I ducked my head and said, "I'm very sorry for your loss."</p><p>She continued as though she hadn't heard me. "I told him not to hire a witch. I told him." Her voice turned shrill, and she collapsed into the wall. "I told him."</p><p>I backed away, allowing the director to ease Mrs. Baker onto a seat. In the distance, sirens hurtled down the street.</p><p>The phone squawked in my hand. "Alexis, are you there?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm here. You said something about a Teddy."</p><p>The line was silent long enough that I wondered if she'd hung up; then she said, "Theodore Coleman? Surely you've heard of him. The police found his body last night. I need to know who shot him and where he's been these past two weeks."</p><p>I almost dropped the phone. She <i>had</i> to be kidding. Vice presidential hopeful Governor Theodore Coleman? A restaurant's surveillance camera had caught the shooting, but then Coleman had disappeared. If his body had been found, it would be a big case. Considering Coleman's political affiliation with the Humans First Party and the party's open disdain for witches my interference wouldn't be appreciated. "Casey, I don't think "</p><p>"Please." Her voice broke again. "The police think Daddy is involved. They've been by the house several times already."</p><p>I rolled my eyes. The police could look, but nothing stuck to Lieutenant Governor George Caine. <i>Well, I guess he's actually the governor now.</i> Our father had deep pockets and a wide reach. After all, he'd buried my name change from Caine to Craft and the fact his daughter was a practicing witch so deep the media hadn't managed to dig it up during his campaign. Besides, I'd barely spoken to him since I'd turned eighteen. I saw him more in the paper and on TV campaigning for the Humans First Party than in person. Why would I get involved now? "Casey, this really isn't "</p><p>"Please. This is what you do right? You're some sort of magic eye?"</p><p>My jaw clenched. "Magic eye" was slang for a witch with a private detective license who did very little "real" investigative work. While I might not trail leads through dark alleys, and my investigations typically went only as far as questioning the deceased, I did find answers for my clients.</p><p>I took a deep breath and forced a smile to spread across my face, to seep into my voice. "I'm sorry. I can't help you." The words came out sickly sweet, but I didn't talk to my sister enough for her to recognize the tone. "I can't get involved in an ongoing police investigation."</p><p>"I can pay you."</p><p>I frowned at the phone. Last I'd heard, Casey had bought into the antiwitch position of the Humans First Party. If she was willing to actually hire me, she must be truly worried.</p><p>"Please, Alexis. Please. I need your help."</p><p>"Okay." Damn. I was working for my little sister, but I'd look into the case. See what I could find. With a sigh, I rattled off my standard legal spiel, quoted my rates, and told Casey to expect an e-mailed copy of my contract later that afternoon. As I spoke, the sirens hurtled closer, and I shouldered my purse with its thirteen cents, gum wrapper, and paper clip.</p><p>"When will you talk to the ghost?"</p><p><i>Ghost?</i> I suppressed a groan but didn't bother correcting her. After all these years, if she hadn't grasped the fact that ghosts were cognizant, wandering souls, but shades were just memories, she clearly hadn't been paying me any attention. Instead I said, "If you want to be present to question Coleman's shade, we'll have to wait until the police release the body and it's in the ground. If you want faster answers, I might be able to question him at the morgue, but you can't attend the ritual."</p><p>The line was silent except for soft, ragged breaths on the other side. I gave her a moment to think as the sound of sirens drew closer.</p><p>"The morgue." Casey's voice dropped in pitch. "How soon will you get back to me?"</p><p>Getting access to a high-profile body in an open case would be difficult, but I'd built connections during my three years of running Tongues for the Dead. "I have a friend at the station. I'll give him a call, but I can't make any promises. I'll contact you tonight if I get access to the morgue today. Otherwise, expect me to check in tomorrow afternoon."</p><p>Wrapping up the call, I saved Casey's number and moved to get the door for the paramedics. The ambulance pulled to a stop, and a black and white cop car jetted to the curb behind it. Good maybe the cops could give me a ride. The chill of Mrs. Baker's glare crawled across my shoulders. I wanted to catch a ride in the front seat of the cop car not in the back of the wagon, under arrest.</p><p>As the paramedics rushed up the stairs I scrolled through the contacts on my phone until I reached the number for my friendly neighborhood homicide detective. A gruff voice answered on the third ring.</p><p>"Hey, John," I said as I stepped clear of the emergency workers. "I need a favor."</p><br><p>The doors to the Nekros City Central Precinct slid open, allowing the sixty-degree air inside to escape. The sweat clinging to my skin from the short walk across the blacktop chilled instantly. Six p.m. and the temperature hadn't dropped under a hundred yet. The South in the summer you had to love it.</p><p>I swiped the escaped blond curls plastered to my face back into a messy ponytail and turned to wave to the two officers who'd given me a ride. I hadn't been arrested in connection to Baker's death, but there had been some tense moments back at the funeral parlor. Luckily, when Tamara, the medical examiner, arrived, she'd been able to confirm the absence of magical influence on the body during her initial examination, which freed me to follow up with John at the morgue. My favorite homicide detective had agreed to get me in to see Coleman's body, but only if I did a favor for him in return. In this case, "a favor" translated into raising an extra shade.</p><p>The cops turned out of the parking lot, and I stepped between the automatic doors and headed for the security check. I dug my wallet and ceremonial knife from my purse before dropping the bag on the conveyer belt. As my purse disappeared under the X-ray machine I put the knife in the basket the guard gave me. Then I handed the basket and my wallet open to display my PI license and my magical certification issued by the Organization for Magically Inclined Humans OMIH for short to the guard. He glanced over my credentials before confiscating the knife, which I'd pretty much expected. Turning, I walked through the metal detector. No issue there, but the spell detector beeped loudly as I stepped through.</p><p>The security guard motioned me to stop and grabbed a spellchecker wand. "Hands out, palms up."</p><p>I did as he instructed, tapping my toe inside my boot as he waved the wand with its rudimentary detection spell over me. The glass bead on the tip glowed green as it moved over my right hand and the obsidian ring I stored raw magic in. Green meant magic, but not an active spell. On my other wrist, the bead glowed yellow as it traced over my shield bracelet active magic, but not a malicious charm. Malicious spells, even inactive ones, made the bead glow red. The bead didn't turn red.</p><p>With a nod, the guard motioned for me to drop my hands as he placed the wand back in its stand. I grabbed my purse, my wallet, and the ticket I'd need to reclaim my knife when I left. Then I made my way to the elevators.</p><p>Central Precinct was an austere but multipurpose building situated in the middle of downtown Nekros in what people tended to refer to as the judicial block because of the proximity of the statehouse, the state supreme court, and Central Precinct. Though it was not overly apparent from the back of the building, where I'd entered, the main floor housed Nekros City's central police station as well as the...</p></p><h2>As Above, So Below: Art of the American Fraternal Society, 1850-1930</h2><p><blockquote><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an inspiring and wacky solemnity in these organizations&#x2014;high values reinforced through pageantry and performance in an ecumenical social setting&#x2014;which deep down must also have been a whole lot of fun. Now it&#x2019;s as if that foundational Other America, that underpinning of the America we know, has gradually eroded, and here we remain, living in a world that is a mere shell, a movie set, of the world that made our world manifest, that brought it into being, and all we have left are these perplexing masks, banners, and costumes to puzzle over.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Byrne, from the foreword</p></blockquote><p>Featuring more than two hundred outstanding objects gathered from private and public collections,<i> As Above, So Below</i> provides the first comprehensive survey of the rich vein of art created during the &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of the American fraternal society. By the turn of the twentieth century, an estimated 70,000 local lodges affiliated with hundreds of distinct American fraternal societies claimed a combined five and a half million members. It has been estimated that at least 20 percent of the American adult male population belonged to one or more fraternal orders, including the two largest groups, the Freemasons and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The esoteric knowledge, visual symbols, and moral teachings revealed to lodge brothers during secret rituals inspired an abundant and expressive body of objects that form an important facet of American folk art.</p><p>Lynne Adele and Bruce Lee Webb introduce the reader to fraternal societies and explore the function and meaning of fraternal objects, including paintings and banners, costumes and ceremonial regalia, ritual objects, and an array of idiosyncratic objects that represent a grassroots response to fraternalism. Setting the art in historical context, the authors examine how fraternal societies contributed to American visual culture during this era of burgeoning fraternal activity. Simultaneously entertaining and respectful of the fraternal tradition, <i>As Above, So Below</i> opens lodge room doors and invites the reader to explore the compelling and often misunderstood works from the golden age of fraternity, once largely forgotten and now coveted by collectors.</p></p><p>Lynne Adele, an independent art historian with an extensive art museum and commercial art gallery background, has specialized in the work of self-taught, folk, and outsider artists for more than twenty-five years. She has written and contributed to numerous exhibition catalogs, books, and journals on American folk art; her exhibition catalog Spirited Journeys: Self-Taught Texas Artists of the Twentieth Century has become a standard reference in the field."It&#x2019;s a book so beautifully designed and illustrated that one is tempted to don a fez and make a secret sign."

Wade</i>&nbsp;to the legal battle over the death of Nancy Cruzan, no issues have opened greater rifts in American society than those of abortion and euthanasia.&nbsp;<br>At the heart of <i>Life's Dominion </i>is Dworkin's inquest into <i>why</i>&nbsp;abortion and euthanasia provoke such controversy. Do these acts violate some fundamental "right to life"? Or are the objections against them based on the belief that human life is sacred? Combining incisive moral reasoning and close readings of indicidual court decisions with a majestic interpretation of the U.S. Constitution itself, Dworkin gives us a work that is absolutely essential for anyone who cares about the legal status of human life.</p><p>"A wonderfully rich and evocative investigation into the choices that confront us at the edges of life and death."--Lawrence Tribe, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Dworkin has made a miracle, so meticulous and rich a reformulation of how we think about the borders between life and death that it illuminates the very nature of how we live our lives."--Joan Didion. <br>One of the country&#39;s most distinguished scholars presents a brilliantly original approach to the twin dilemmas of abortion and euthanasia, showing why they arouse such volcanic controversy and how we as a society can reconcile our values of life and individual liberty.</p><h2>R.

Together they pursued what would become the cornerstone of the American dream�having a family and owning property where they could live, grow, and prosper. Owning land in both Vermont and Massachusetts, they were well on their way to settling in when bigoted neighbors tried to run them off. Rather than fleeing, they asserted their rights, as they would do many times, in court. </p> <p>Here is a story that not only demonstrates the contours of slavery in New England but also unravels the most complete history of a pre-Civil War black family known to exist. Illuminating and inspiring, <i>Mr. and Mrs. Prince</i> uncovers the lives of those who could have been forgotten and brings to light a history that has intrigued but eluded many until now. </p></p><p><p>Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina is the author and editor of several books, including <em>Carrington</em>; <em>Black London</em> (a <em>New York Times</em> notable book); <em>Black Victorians</em>, <em>Black Victoriana</em>; <em>Frances Hodgson Burnett</em>; and others. She is the Kathe Tappe Vernon Professor in Biography at Dartmouth College, where she also chairs the English Department, the first African-American woman to do so in the Ivy League. She has won grants from Fulbright and the National Endowment for Humanities and hosts <em>The Book Show</em>, a nationally syndicated weekly radio program that airs on ninety stations across the country, interviewing current authors of literary fiction, biography, and history.</p>Abijah and Lucy Prince defied all the conventions of their pre&#x2013;Civil War era by buying themselves out of slavery and going on to become landowners and influential members of their communities in Vermont and Massachusetts. He was a veteran of the Revolutionary War; she was the first published African American poet; both were skilled entrepreneurs who faced down every challenge to their efforts. They stood up to those who tried to force them off their land, mounting court challenges and taking full advantage of their rights. Historian Gerzina intersperses their story&#x2014;one of devotion and determination&#x2014;with her own obvious love of genealogy and research. In the course of her work, aided by her husband, who became captivated and competitive in finding defining resources, Gerzina discovered a connection between her mixed-race family and the Princes. She is meticulous and joyous in this look at the Princes and the social and political landscape of enslaved and free black communities&nbsp;in New England. --Vanessa Bush</p>
